        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium eggplants (about 1.5 - 2 lbs total), Asian or Italian varieties work beautifully here</li>
            <li>Kosher salt, for seasoning and drawing out moisture</li>
            <li>¼ cup neutral cooking oil, such as grapeseed, canola, or avocado oil</li>
            <li>16 cloves garlic, preferably fresh and firm; 8 cloves thinly sliced, 8 cloves finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves, dried or fresh</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, coarsely crushed (a mortar and pestle is ideal here, but a ziploc bag and a rolling pin work too!)</li>
            <li>½ cup full-fat coconut cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce (a good quality, naturally brewed one will make a difference)</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice vinegar (unseasoned is preferred for better control of flavor)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>3 scallions, green and white parts, thinly sliced on the bias</li>
            <li>Optional: 3 Thai chili peppers, thinly sliced into rounds (adjust to your heat preference)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <div>
                    <strong>Prepare the Eggplant:</strong> Start by halving your eggplants lengthwise. With the cut side facing up, use the tip of your knife to score the flesh in a crosshatch pattern, about ½ inch deep, being careful not to cut through the skin. This allows the eggplant to absorb all those beautiful flavors and cook more evenly. Now, sprinkle the cut surfaces liberally with kosher salt – don’t be shy! We're doing what we call "sweating" the eggplant. This draws out excess moisture and bitterness, which will prevent your eggplant from becoming watery and will help it brown beautifully later. Place the salted eggplant halves, cut-side down, on a sheet tray or a few layers of paper towels, and let them rest for at least 20 minutes. You’ll see beads of moisture form on the surface – that’s exactly what we want.

            </li>

                <div>
                    <strong>Crispy Garlic Interlude:</strong> While your eggplant is doing its thing, let's make those addictive crispy garlic chips. In a cold 10 or 12-inch skillet, pour in your ¼ cup of neutral cooking oil. Add the thinly sliced garlic cloves to the cold oil. This gentle start is key; it allows the garlic to slowly infuse the oil and become golden without burning. Place the skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently with a pair of tweezers or chopsticks (they give you great control!), until the garlic slices turn a beautiful, light golden-brown, about 4-6 minutes. Keep a close eye on them, as garlic can go from perfectly golden to burnt in a flash. The moment they hit that lovely color, use a slotted spoon to quickly remove them from the oil and spread them in a single layer on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Immediately sprinkle with a tiny pinch of salt. They'll crisp up further as they cool, turning into irresistible little flavor bombs. Set these aside – try not to eat them all!

            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    <strong>Sear the Eggplant:</strong> Now, let's get that eggplant caramelized. Pat the eggplant halves thoroughly dry with paper towels, pressing gently to remove as much moisture as possible. The drier the eggplant, the better it will sear. Increase the heat under your skillet (the one with the garlic-infused oil) to medium-high. Once the oil shimmers, carefully lay the eggplant halves, cut-side down, in the hot oil. You might need to do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan; we want to sear, not steam. Cook for about 6 minutes, resisting the urge to move them too much, until they develop a deep, golden-brown crust. This browning creates incredible flavor. Flip each eggplant half and cook for another 2 minutes on the skin side, just to soften it slightly. Remove the seared eggplant from the skillet and set it aside on a plate. Repeat with any remaining eggplant.

                <div>
                    <strong>Build the Adobo Base:</strong> Reduce the heat in your skillet to low. Add the remaining 8 chopped garlic cloves, bay leaves, and coarsely crushed black peppercorns to the oil. Cook, stirring gently, for about 2 minutes. You're looking for the aromatics to become fragrant and the chopped garlic to just begin to turn light golden, not deep brown. This gentle cooking extracts their essence without bitterness.

            <li>
                <div>
                    <strong>Simmer the Adobo:</strong> Pour in the coconut cream, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and packed brown sugar. Stir well to combine, ensuring the brown sugar dissolves completely. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, letting it burble softly. Now, carefully nestle the seared eggplant halves back into the simmering sauce. They should be mostly submerged. Cover the skillet with a lid and continue to simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the eggplant is truly tender and yielding when pierced with a fork. Halfway through the cooking time, gently flip the eggplant halves to ensure even cooking and absorption of the adobo goodness.

            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Once the eggplant is tender and the sauce has thickened slightly, turn off the heat. Transfer the eggplant halves to a serving platter, spooning that luscious adobo sauce generously over them. Finish by scattering the crispy garlic chips, fresh sliced scallions, and the optional vibrant Thai chili peppers over the top. The fresh elements provide a welcome contrast to the rich adobo. Serve immediately with plenty of hot steamed rice to soak up all that incredible sauce.
