<h1 id="the-case-for-lunch"><strong>The Case for Lunch</strong></h1>
<p>By Lauren Collins</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1962, Roxane Debuisson, a Parisian housewife in her thirties, was walking down the Rue de Birague, in the Marais, when one of a pair of gilded iron balls—a traditional emblem of barbers—detached from its bracket and almost conked her on the head. The salon’s proprietor, it turned out, planned to replace them with a neon sign. This was <em>les trente glorieuses</em>, the postwar years in which French society raced toward modernity, leaving the past in the dust of massive state-sponsored construction projects. Debuisson took the remaining orb home, thereby beginning an exceptional collection of Paris ephemera—previously commonplace objects that were disappearing before her eyes.</p>
<p>“The collection began out of my love for Paris and my love of the street,” Debuisson later said. For decades, she conducted a one-woman salvage operation, scooping up rating plates, bench marks, pieces of bridges, tree corsets, street signs, fountains, gallows, Métro seats, mailboxes, and some seventy thousand commercial invoices. A 1970 photograph by her friend Robert Doisneau shows her in a coat and kerchief, crouching on the pavement to examine a dilapidated bust of Molière, rescued from a bakery near the Pont Neuf.</p>
<p>Debuisson detailed each of her finds in files stored in beige boxes and also displayed them in her apartment, at 19 Boulevard Henri IV, creating what was perhaps Paris’s finest private museum. (She was apparently generous about showing people around, and I will always regret not having seen it.) Every room but the kitchen was stuffed with treasure. A visitor could walk through corridors hung thick with shop signs—a cobbler’s boot, a glove-maker’s hand, a six-and-a-half-foot-tall pair of scissors, two gilded snails—into the dining room, where an entire wall was given over to a set of enamel-and-glass panels from a defunct pâtisserie. After Debuisson died, in 2018, her children sold many of her artifacts at auction; one article paid tribute to her as a “Proustian personage.”</p>
<p>But Debuisson’s Paris collection was, to many people, only the <em>second</em> most interesting thing about her. In her later years, she led an equally intense double life in the realm of food. My introduction to her came one day as I was flipping through a culinary encyclopedia, “On Va Déguster Paris” (“Let’s Eat Paris”), by François-Régis Gaudry and collaborators. The book featured an illustration of Debuisson in her signature look: printed blouse, sleek gray chignon, dark glasses worn inside. Her entry, by the food writer Ezéchiel Zérah, remembered her as the “godmother of grand restaurants,” noting that for decades she dined daily at a “Michelin-starred table or a palace restaurant.”</p>
<p>And did she ever, setting out each morning in a navy-blue Rolls-Royce Phantom V to cruise the city, belting out the classics of <em>la chanson française</em> with her chauffeur, the lyrics scribbled on index cards that she would produce from her handbag. The sale of her husband’s I.T. company to I.B.M., in the nineties, permitted Debuisson to do as she pleased in meals as in memorabilia. At each fine-dining establishment, she had a favorite dish: <em>chausson aux truffes</em> (L’Ambroisie), <em>bugnes</em> (the Ritz), <em>clafoutis et la caroline au café</em> (the Plaza Athénée), <em>pommes soufflées</em> (Le Meurice), mille-feuille (Le Grand Véfour), honey ice cream and frangipane tart (Drouant). Everywhere, wines by the magnum. If Ruinart Blanc de Blancs, her preferred champagne, wasn’t available, she sent out for it, once dispatching her driver all the way to Reims. She could be demanding, but she tipped big.</p>
<p>One eulogy noted, “She loved every element of the French restaurant ritual: chefs, seconds, commis, pastry chefs, cheesemongers, dining room managers, cloakroom attendants, waiters, florists, bellhops, valets, whom she knew by their first and last names.” Eating this way was another form of classifying and collecting. Debuisson amassed chef friends, feasting on culinary lore and gossip alongside their creations. Toward the end of her life, she received the luminaries of the food world at her apartment, presiding in a pink bathrobe and scarf. Forty chefs showed up for her funeral, all in white toques. <em>Food &amp; Sens</em> memorialized Debuisson as a “gastronomic grande dame,” but, amazingly, her epicurean career took place entirely during daylight hours. She never ate dinner, considering lunch superior.</p>
<p>However you rate lunch, it is probably the original meal—for much of history, procuring food and finding fuel to cook it with took so long that people were unable to eat until several hours after waking up. At the same time, the amount of physical labor early humans performed required them to consume the bulk of the day’s calories as soon as they were available. “So eating meant lunching if we take lunch to be the meal eaten in the middle of the day,” the food historian Megan Elias writes in “Lunch: A History.” As a class system emerged, the rich began to eat multiple times a day. The middle class followed, and eventually advances in lighting technology expanded the duration of daily activity, allowing for extended eating hours. By around 1850, the midday mono-meal had diversified into the three-meal system that now dominates Western culture.</p>
<p>Per Samuel Johnson’s dictionary, the word “lunch” likely derives from “clunch” or “clutch,” meaning “as much food as one’s hand can hold.” A lunch can be quick and convenient: tomato soup, grilled cheese, poke bowl, burrito, tuna salad, leftover pad kee mao, or office-microwaved miso salmon. Or it can serve as a redoubt of leisure and even decadence in an ever-optimizing world: the simmering Sunday ragù, the midday Martini, the vacation table laid at two o’clock and not abandoned until the heat fades. So many lunches, so little time—hot lunch, cold lunch, liquid lunch, naked lunch. Lunch is the Thanksgiving of meals, neither underwhelming nor extra luxurious, adapting easily to various contingencies and configurations. It is what you make of it, whether you’re lingering over <em>mignardises</em> at Le Grand Véfour or scarfing down last night’s beans.</p>
<p>Unlike breakfast, lunch offers variety, but, in contrast to dinner, it tolerates repetition. I can measure my life in lunches: tepid ham-on-wheat sandwiches, gently curling like fortune-telling fish and infused with a weird hint of citrus from the clementine that inevitably accompanied them in my lunchbox (ages five through eighteen, North Carolina); vinegary barbecue, hush puppies, and a ten-cent York peppermint patty from a cardboard dispenser at Merritt’s (on the odd childhood day my mom had to take me to a doctor’s appointment); bagels with turkey, Swiss, and spicy mustard (ages eighteen through twenty-two, college); lamb-and-rice plates from halal carts, the Così salad with grapes and Gorgonzola (ages twenty-two through thirty, New York); the W.F.H.-er’s wild array of refrigerator forage, often topped with an egg and always followed by a cup of tea and two squares of dark chocolate (age thirty and on). And that’s leaving out weekend lunches—back-yard barbecues, dim-sum feasts, my own lunch wedding—which lend themselves to unhurried socializing and multigenerational exchange. Everyone’s awake; no one has to drive at night. Indulge by day, then take a walk or watch a movie.</p>
<p>Recently, the food publication <em>Mashed</em> polled some thirty-four thousand people about their eating preferences. Fifty-two per cent named dinner their favorite of the “Big 3” meals. Perhaps these people enjoy spending more money on identical restaurant dishes, enduring poor digestion, and having to hire a babysitter. Perhaps one of them is King Charles, who purportedly believes that lunch is a “luxury.” Or Donald Trump, who is said to go up to sixteen hours without eating, avoiding breakfast and often shunning lunch before gorging on a dinner of two Big Macs and two Filets-O-Fish, washed down with a chocolate shake. (Meanwhile, more than forty-seven million Americans live in food-insecure households, a number sure to increase with recent cuts to <em>SNAP</em> benefits.) In a meal competition, I’d put my money on Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson, who reportedly eats six meals a day, several of them presumably lunches, a regimen that once had him consuming some eight hundred and twenty-one pounds of cod per year.</p>
<p>As though the case for lunch were not strong enough, it is the only meal that, for many months of the year, reliably allows the person eating it to simultaneously experience the pleasures of food and light. With the day stretching out ahead of you, lunch can feel less transactional and slotted in than other meals. It’s a moment out of time—the August of the day. The only meal with a plethora of dedicated receptacles? That’s lunch, muse of lunch pails, bentos, picnic baskets, <em>dosirak</em>, tiffins. (In keeping with the decline of midday home cooking, the Mumbai <em>dabbawalas</em>, who have delivered lunchboxes to Indian office workers for more than a century, recently opened a cloud kitchen.) The sweaty, surprisingly sexy meal of bustling sidewalks, office workers sprawled on the grass of city squares, and Frank O’Hara’s “laborers [who] feed their dirty / glistening torsos sandwiches / and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets / on”? Also lunch. Would anyone buy Breakfastables? (At one point, Oscar Mayer did introduce a line of morning snacks—bacon and pancake dippers, little cinnamon rolls—but they were called Lunchables Breakfast.)</p>
<p>Indisputably, lunch is the most public meal, with “a long history of establishing social status and cementing alliances,” Elias writes. It is the meal you are most likely to eat outside of the home, with people who are not your immediate relatives, unless you are one of the five children of the LVMH boss Bernard Arnault. Reportedly, he convenes his family once a month for an “exactly 90-minute-long lunch” in order to “drill his offspring on company strategy and manager performance.” They might consider the example of the Coney Island restaurateur Nathan Handwerker, who supposedly hired college students to hang around his hot-dog stand in white coats so that passersby would think that they were doctors on lunch break from a nearby hospital, their presence testifying to the impeccable quality of Nathan’s kosher-style franks.</p>
<p>Recently, I was invited to lunch at the home of a woman who does not eat lunch. “One day, I went to a business lunch, and I looked at the menu and just thought, <em>I’m not hungry</em>,” my host, the cook and writer Perla Servan-Schreiber, recalled. That was some fifty years ago. For decades, Servan-Schreiber and her husband, Jean-Louis, breakfasted together, worked all day, and broke at 4 <em>P</em>.<em>M</em>. for tea and cakes. Then, in 2020, Jean-Louis died of <em>COVID</em>. A pair of Servan-Schreiber’s younger friends, Émilien Crespo and Fany Péchiodat, came up with a ritual they call Magic Lunch: Servan-Schreiber cooks, and they invite fun guests around for the meal, of which she herself does not partake. (Péchiodat, it should be noted, also maintains an unhinged annual ritual of having her birthday dinner with someone she’s never met.)</p>
<p>Why lunch? “It’s almost subversive,” Crespo explained, over a plate of Servan-Schreiber’s red rice and spiced lamb meatballs. “It feels a little naughty telling people it may last until four o’clock and they have to cancel all their plans.” Servan-Schreiber said that lunch felt more “recreational” than a rushed breakfast or a formal dinner. “Plus,” she added, with a glimmer in her eye, “you’re not obliged to invite couples!”</p>
<p>Last fall, in London, the chef Hugh Corcoran, the publisher Frances Armstrong-Jones, and their friend Oisín Davies opened a restaurant that serves only lunch, and a lot of people in the small world of the city’s restaurant reviewing got disproportionately worked up about it. The restaurant is called the Yellow Bittern, after an eighteenth-century Irish poem about a sad bird in a “wineless place,” and includes a bookshop in the basement. It is open only on weekdays and accepts reservations by phone or, supposedly, postcard. It does not take credit cards or have a written wine list. When it’s cold out, you have to ring a doorbell to get in. This is the litany of quirks that begins every discussion of the Yellow Bittern, whose most idiosyncratic feature is actually its ability, deliberate or not, to activate a full complement of resentments, allegiances, and anxieties via bowls of soup and dollops of rice pudding served exclusively between the hours of twelve and four-thirtyish.</p>
<p>The Belfast-born Corcoran and the English-born Armstrong-Jones are romantic partners as well as co-proprietors, complicating the traditional man-at-the-stove/woman-in-the-front-of-the-house dynamic with a prole/posh overlay: his father was an auto mechanic; hers, the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, first Earl of Snowdon, who was once married to Princess Margaret. These biographical facts were tantalizing to the British press. That the couple managed their own P.R.—that is, they simply answered questions about their restaurant, sometimes on the fly—and dressed in old-timey woollens and brogues made them irresistible. In the <em>Guardian</em>, Jay Rayner wrote that Corcoran “has about him the mien of a 1930s small-town butcher who has a lovely piece of gammon put aside for you,” and poked fun at “Lady Frances’s” whispery locutions. The Yellow Bittern, he suggested, walked “a fine line” between simplicity and taking its patrons for fools.</p>
<p>The real drama started about two weeks in, when Corcoran, who is also a writer, took to Instagram to denounce diners who treat restaurants like “public benches,” parking themselves at a table for hours, only to “order one starter and two mains to share and a glass of tap water” for a party of four. He continued, “At the very least, order correctly, drink some wine, and justify your presence in the room.” His frustration was understandable for a small businessman (even if it demonstrated a certain obliviousness to the many reasons a person might decline alcohol—do pregnant women, or Muslims, say, merit a seat at his table?). But some people did not appreciate his attempt to impose a more languid, indulgent rhythm on the midday pause, accusing him of entitlement, whining, “giving a giant middle finger to rather a lot of London,” and running “an 18-seat piece of performance art within which diners are unsuspecting subjects of a dining diktat delivered with all the fiscal charm of Ebenezer Scrooge.”</p>
<p>It probably did not help that Corcoran proudly proclaimed himself a Communist, displaying a portrait of Lenin in the Yellow Bittern’s dining room and a hammer-and-sickle tattoo on his right forearm. Or that he claimed that a unionized railroad worker would “definitely be able to afford” a meal at the restaurant, while regretting that it was likely inaccessible to “Deliveroo guys on bicycles,” whom he identified as “the new lowest rank of the proletariat.” A meat pie for two costs forty pounds at the Yellow Bittern. The average lunch break in the U.K., for workers who have one, lasts thirty-three minutes. Nevertheless, Corcoran argued that he was creating a “democratic space” and even an antifascist one, free from “technology and exclusivity” and “people who pay with their watches.”</p>
<p>However eccentric his politics, Corcoran’s message was clear enough: he was taking a stand against the vending machine, the crumb-covered keyboard, the putrefying banana, the leaden ciabatta, the tragic hummus wrap from Pret. As the controversy spread across the Atlantic, he told the New York <em>Times</em>, “Is this the kind of society that we were trying to create? . . . We have to fight for lunch.”</p>

<p>Expressing an earnest opinion is the British equivalent of walking down a crowded street wearing a “Kick Me” sign. Commentators lined up to administer their licks, with a surprising number of them pummelling the idea of lunch itself, as though the meal were some kind of abominable kink. “What I find shocking is that four people might go out for a weekday lunch at all, let alone order main courses,” Hilary Rose wrote, in the U.K. <em>Times</em>. “How do you find the time, and the money? What does your boss think? I haven’t been out for a weekday restaurant lunch in decades, and even when I go out for dinner, I never have a main course.” That may qualify as a personal matter, but the middling status of lunch in the hierarchy of meals invited all manner of projection. The phrase “it’s only lunch” had never seemed more disingenuous, Jonathan Nunn observed in the magazine <em>Vittles</em>, writing that the Yellow Bittern was “a rich text, even before you get into the important matter of whether the food is any good.”</p>
<p>In March, I invited a friend—an editor, alas, not a signalman or plate layer—to join me for the two-o’clock sitting at the Yellow Bittern. Just for kicks, I had tried to make a reservation by postcard, sending a Joachim Beuckelaer painting of a head of cabbage. (Embarrassing to be so on-theme bougie foodie, but it was what I had on hand.) A few weeks went by with no reply. Figuring that the postcard had got lost, I e-mailed Armstrong-Jones to book a table. Nobody seemed to mind the technological intrusion.</p>
<p>When the day arrived, I buzzed. Armstrong-Jones escorted me through a yolk-colored room with an English Oak banquette along one wall and to a snug table near the kitchen. The kitchen comprised a single oven and two induction burners, underneath a large casement window that was pleasingly left open. Corcoran stood behind the counter in a billowing blouse and a burgundy sweater vest, surrounded by the day’s offerings: a hotel pan full of roasted guinea fowl; a plate of butter; a cherry-colored cast-iron pot of stew. Cooling nearby were a few loaves of speckled soda bread baked by Davies.</p>
<p>It was lunch, so there was sunshine, streaming into the dining room, backlighting the cursive lettering on the plate-glass windows. I felt as though I had just put on a cloche and pulled up a seat in the cafeteria of a Hopper painting. A white-haired man consulted the menu with reading glasses, attached to his neck with an <em>ENGLAND</em> 2015 strap. (Rugby, if I had to bet.) The table was set with a posy in a parfait glass and a pot of Colman’s mustard. I scanned the room and saw an old-school reservation book lying open on a stool, paperweighted by a cordless phone. It seemed natural in the setting, rather than stagy.</p>
<p>We decided to comport ourselves as Corcoran’s ideal patrons: hungry, thirsty omnivores constrained by neither watch nor wallet. We started with sherry apéritifs, per Corcoran’s suggestion. I ordered celeriac soup: a homely beige mush, equally heavy on pepper, butter, and cream and devoid of croutons or other crunch-giving garnishes. I loved it. My friend had a crab-and-watercress salad. It was quiet but spoke wittily to notions of lunch by forgoing the fruit element (apple, mango, orange) that often characterizes such dishes. No cantaloupe balls at this luncheon!</p>
<p>We continued with the polemical meat pie, a simple green salad, a Pinot Noir from Alsace, Irish cheeses, and a piece of chocolate tart so dense that it resembled Ultrasuede. The bill was a hundred and seventy-five pounds—about two hundred and twenty-five bucks, before Trump tanked the dollar. The food was excellent, if not revolutionary. Its aggressive plainness paradoxically reminded me of the Dolly Parton saying “It costs a lot of money to look this cheap.” (It takes a lot of imagination, too.) What I appreciated most was the sense of a presiding intelligence in the room, a philosophy expressed with passion if not perfect coherence. Corcoran enlivens the table with endlessly debatable ideas alongside his rabbit in mustard sauce and Scottish langoustines.</p>
<p>I lingered after the meal to speak with Corcoran and Armstrong-Jones. Why lunch, I wanted to know, when dinner would offer a surer route to solvency and acclaim? Corcoran answered first, doubling down on his manifesto: “We live in a society that promotes this idea of constant production—you know, if you’re not in work working, then you should be doing something to be a good worker. To just cut all that and say, ‘Actually, I’m gonna drink a bottle of wine and eat a lot of food in the middle of the day,’ right?”</p>
<p>Armstrong-Jones focussed on the practical benefits of lunch, which also inspired the name of a culture magazine that she publishes, <em>Luncheon</em>. “I had three young children when I started it,” she said. “It was about the day, instead of being about what happened the night before and you feel like you’ve missed out on everything.”</p>
<p>Dinner can almost feel like a domestic space: proposals, breakups. “Lunch is more convivial,” Corcoran said. “People hardly ever get in arguments,” Armstrong-Jones added. Corcoran nonetheless wanted to be clear that he was no lunch naïf. “We shouldn’t forget the dark side of lunch,” he joked, noting that Spain’s ubiquitous <em>menú del día</em>—several courses for a reasonable price, historically set by the government—was conceived by Franco during a period of economic hardship.</p>
<p>Along with sustenance, the money I spent at the Yellow Bittern had bought me time. Time away from the computer and the phone, time outside the family sphere, time to catch up with an old friend—pleasures that, like all luxuries, are difficult to source and can be even more difficult to defend, depending on one’s tolerance for self-indulgence and inequality. British class hysterics aside, the furor over the Yellow Bittern may best be understood as an exercise in the political limits of self-care, individual action, and the iconoclastic stand. Demanding that diners justify their presence in the room, the Yellow Bittern justifies their absence, for better or worse, from the world outside.</p>
<p>Even if lunch is not quite the anti-capitalist oasis of Corcoran’s telling, it has long been associated with the right of working people to restore themselves midway through their daily toil. “Workmen at their benches drop their tools, the stairs resound with hurrying feet, and from every exit pour jostling hordes,” the journalist Granthorpe Sudley wrote in a 1901 article titled “Luncheon for a Million.” In the 1896 Presidential election, William McKinley courted the labor vote with the promise of “A Full Dinner Pail.” (At the time, many people called the evening meal “supper,” so “dinner” in this case meant “lunch.”) In maybe the most famous image of lunch, ironworkers in flat caps and overalls pause for a break eight hundred and fifty feet above the ground on a steel beam. They are supposedly enjoying sandwiches and coffee, but the photograph was in fact a publicity stunt, intended to promote the RCA Building as it was being constructed.</p>
<p>Until women entered the workforce in significant numbers, lunch was also the most gender-segregated meal. Middle-class women whipped up quiche Lorraine and ambrosia salads (often with the help of Black domestic workers, who were excluded from Social Security). With their children’s lunchtime needs accounted for by the National School Lunch Act of 1946—passed after wartime physicals revealed widespread malnutrition—housewives visited department-store canteens and tea rooms like the Syracuse branch of Schrafft’s, “the daintiest luncheon spot in all the State.” Before sliced bread became widely available, women’s magazines were full of advice “on social distinctions and the thickness of bread in sandwiches,” according to the food historian Laura Shapiro. The trick to getting the bread thin enough for distinguished company was to butter the face of the loaf first, slicing as close to the spread as possible. Peanut butter, meanwhile, was introduced as “a high-end spread” popular at ladies’ luncheons, intended to be mixed with enlivening elements, such as celery or nasturtiums.</p>
<p>Recently, when I visited New York, people were lining up for patty melts and cherry-lime rickeys at S &amp; P Lunch, in Flatiron. (It began as S &amp; P Sandwich Shop in 1928, but was known as Eisenberg’s between the late fifties and 2021, after which it was revamped by new owners.) As a public institution, the lunch counter, devoid of tricky reservations and élite tables, represents a certain idea of equality. It is no coincidence that, in 1960, four Black students at North Carolina A&amp;T chose to challenge racial discrimination at a whites-only lunch counter, taking a stand by sitting down on stools below a placard advertising fifteen-cent lemon-meringue pie. The protest and the images that it produced were the picture of American democracy, galvanizing public opinion and accelerating the movement: an unbroken line of citizens seeking simple fare in side-by-side solidarity.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade later, Betty Friedan turned to the symbolic power of lunch in service of equal rights for women, when she and fifteen fellow-protesters installed themselves around a table at the male-only Oak Room in Manhattan. Unable to remove the women, waiters removed the table itself, but the point was made: within months, the decades-old policy of banning women between noon and three was rescinded.</p>
<p>Social justice has not tended to feature on the menu of executive-class lunches, but they, too, are social exhibitions, of both a bombastic commitment to work and the power it has bequeathed. Bricklayers and ironworkers, Sudley noted in 1901, did not “gobble or bolt their food” as Wall Street bankers were wont to do, “sail[ing] through the doorway with streaming coat tails” to snatch up “a sandwich, a fishball, [a] pie” at the nearest restaurant, or sending out for meals from “a white aproned waiter hurrying along with the hastening stream and bearing jealously a tray laden with steaming dishes.” (Messenger boys, for their part, lined up at carts for sausages with a dollop of sauerkraut: “Hey, boss, gimme a dog!”) To place an order with this early version of Seamless or DoorDash was to show that you were busy. The spectacle of the executive lunch reached its apotheosis in Hollywood, at the M-G-M cafeteria, where, Elias writes, three thirty-foot tables were equipped with telephones transmitting urgent messages from on set.</p>
<p>Renunciation, for the executive luncher, is its own form of ostentation. If the power move at a power lunch is ordering off menu (as Cary Grant was known to do at 21, demanding peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches), the most powerful form of power lunching is forgoing the meal altogether (“Lunch is for wimps,” Gordon Gekko declared in “Wall Street”). The publisher Michael Korda once praised the expense-account lunch as “an essential tool of the trade, like a carpenter’s adze.” Yet his colleague Robert Gottlieb found the expectation of daily excess so oppressive that he proposed a moratorium, urging his peers to redirect their lunch money to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The three-Martini lunch was barely holding on in 2003, when the <em>GQ</em> editor Art Cooper suffered a stroke while lunching at the Four Seasons, but it has since evolved to suit contemporary tastes. In a recent issue dedicated to rediscovering “the most inessential and glorious part of the working day” (i.e., lunch), the <em>FT</em> <em>Weekend Magazine</em> visited a London brasserie that offers a special, lunch-appropriate “two-sips Martini.”</p>
<p>Still, the power lunch endures, retreating in periods of economic and moral penny-pinching only to reëmerge when the belts and inhibitions of the ruling class undergo their periodic loosening. Thus, the <em>Robb Report</em> recently declared that “power lunch is back,” and the New York <em>Post</em> reports that “midtown staples like Michael’s and Fresco by Scotto” are “swarming with the city’s movers and shakers.” A look in at the Grill, in the Seagram Building, confirmed that plenty of people are still willing to pay handsomely to wheel and deal among the ghosts of Vernon Jordan and Barbara Walters. “We’re very cognizant of the scalability of a pure model,” someone was actually heard saying. The cheeseburger was as tall and round as a melon. Martinis—a nostalgia order now—arrived with great pomp, poured high until the tinkly end, as though the “Pissing Boy” statue had inspired a midtown cocktail. “We’ll send you the deck,” a man in a blue shirt said, scurrying back to the office after a meal slightly longer and a lot more expensive but not much more fundamentally decadent than one at a Chipotle.</p>
<p>The middle meal, in fact and in spirit, is a bridge, a connector. “Because it offers such rich opportunities for the performance of culture, lunch is a meal in perpetual transition, so that any account of what is commonly eaten in one place or time is likely to change within a generation,” Elias writes. Psychologists and educators tell us that a distinguishing feature of our era is loneliness. According to a 2023 advisory by the Surgeon General, America is in the throes of an “epidemic of loneliness,” with roughly half of adults reporting feelings of isolation, which can increase the risk of premature death as much as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day. Young people, alienated by the pandemic and social media, are turning to religion as a source of connection. God is great, but sometimes fellowship—a certain kind of existing in social space—can be as simple as a tuna sandwich. Plus, you get a pickle. ♦</p>
<h1 id="in-an-age-of-climate-change-how-do-we-cope-with-floods"><strong>In an Age of Climate Change, How Do We Cope with Floods?</strong></h1>
<p>By John Seabrook<br>7/21/2025</p>
<hr>
<p>On the evening of July 3rd, as the sun went down over Kerrville, Texas, a small city of some twenty-five thousand people and the seat of Kerr County, the water in the Guadalupe River was just four inches deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s stream gauge there. The area hadn’t had any rain since mid-June. R.V. campers in the HTR TX Hill Country campground in Kerrville, some of whom had arrived at the sixty-five-acre facility only hours before, could barely hear the river, even though they were parked in premium spots next to it.</p>
<p>At 3:30 <em>A.M.</em> on July 4th, Dalton Rice, the city manager, went out for an early-morning jog along the sluggish waterway. The river had risen to 1.71 feet, around the average depth. Kerrville’s much anticipated “Fourth on the River” celebration at the riverside Louise Hays Park was scheduled for that afternoon, and Rice saw “not a drop of rain” during his run, he later told Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas. By 4 <em>A.M.</em>, when Rice went home, “there was very light rain,” he said that day. “We did not see any signs of the river rising at that time.”</p>
<p>Rice was apparently unaware that a few hours earlier, at 1:14 <em>A.M.</em>, the Austin-San Antonio office of the National Weather Service had sent a flash-flood warning for south-central Kerr County. The area it covered included the town of Hunt, about twelve miles upstream from Kerrville, where <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-texas-floods-and-the-lives-lost-at-camp-mystic">Camp Mystic</a>, a girls’ sleepaway camp, was situated, at the confluence of Cypress Creek and the south fork of the Guadalupe. At 4:03 <em>A.M.</em>, the warning was upgraded to an emergency: “This is a <em>PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW</em>!” The stream gauge at Hunt showed the river nearing twenty-two feet, twelve feet higher than its banks. In the next hour, it would rise to thirty-seven feet, at which point the gauge stopped transmitting.</p>
<p>Network-news footage of flood-related disasters has traditionally shown low-lying coastal towns swamped by storm surges from named weather systems, with residents and rescue workers navigating the streets in hip waders, canoes, and powerboats, and the water level sometimes taking days to subside. <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/news/as-told-to/the-view-from-houston-as-harveys-flood-waters-rise">Houston</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/louisianas-disappearing-coast">New Orleans</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-floridians-who-weathered-the-worst-of-hurricane-irma">Tampa</a>, Charleston, and <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/hurricane-sandy-in-photos">New York</a> are among the cities that have been inundated in the past three decades. Yet storm-surge-driven inundation flooding is not the deadliest kind of flood. The disaster often unfolds slowly enough that there’s time for many people to get to higher ground—and for weather reporters to get in place. The water isn’t moving anywhere near as fast as that of a flooded river. The flowing water in a mad river reshapes the entire landscape, a process known as fluvial erosion.</p>
<p>The flood barrelling down on Kerr County more resembled a tornado or a wildfire, a volatile, rapidly changing hazard, with a narrow window within which to act before the deadly force of the raging river arrived at your door. The September, 2024, floods that killed a hundred and eight people in the high country of western North Carolina, when <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/outrage-and-paranoia-after-hurricane-helene">Hurricane Helene</a> passed over, were this kind of event, as were the floods in Valencia, Spain, in late October, 2024, which killed two hundred and thirty-two people. The recent flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico, which claimed three lives, was, too. In my part-time home of Vermont, storms flooded much of the state, including the capital, Montpelier, in July, 2023, and flooding caused by the remnants of Hurricane Beryl hit the town of Plainfield, among other places, in July, 2024. Two people died in each event, and the damage from erosion was severe. The 2023 disaster wasn’t even caused by a named storm. Rain-soaked “thunder boomers” were enough to do the damage.</p>
<p>Historically, this kind of flooding, which often occurs in hilly and mountainous regions, has received far less attention than storm-surge flooding, and local municipalities tend to be less prepared than coastal towns to deal with it. People who have moved away from the beach to escape hurricanes and rising sea levels, and have settled in supposed “climate havens” like Asheville, North Carolina, or Plymouth, Vermont, are reluctant to accept that they have merely traded a devil they know for one they don’t. Francis J. Magilligan, a fluvial geomorphologist at Dartmouth College, told me, “We are actually getting pretty good at figuring out inundation risk. I would say, comparatively, we’re at the starting point of thinking about erosional risk. And we don’t have a good set of tools, <em>FEMA</em> or otherwise, to understand that risk.”</p>
<p>The floodplain maps that the Federal Emergency Management Agency uses to designate a Special Flood Hazard Area, or S.F.H.A., are based on historical climate and geological data. The maps don’t show the actual boundaries of past floods; rather, they illustrate statistical constructs based on the probability that a flood of a certain magnitude will occur there in a certain time range. The National Flood Insurance Program uses the maps to calculate risk. People who live in a hundred-year floodplain, for example, have a one-per-cent chance of being flooded in any given year. Anyone who builds or buys property in a mapped floodplain must take out federal flood insurance in order to qualify for a mortgage. The maps cover the coastal areas and the borders of major rivers, like the Mississippi, that flood frequently. They often don’t cover mountainous communities with smaller rivers and streams, where flooding can affect not only people living down by a river but also those living on banks high above it, whose homes may be lost to erosion. Moreover, most of the data <em>FEMA</em> uses to designate S.F.H.A.s are based on readings from the nineteen-sixties and earlier—data that climate change has largely rendered obsolete. The language, too, engenders a false sense of confidence. It makes it sound as though a bad flood will occur only once every hundred years, and that’s not the way the statistic is supposed to work.</p>
<p>Flash floods often occur in terrain with steep, narrow valleys that drain into rivers where the water is confined in natural and man-made channels and has nowhere else to go. The trigger is very heavy, concentrated rainfall. Warmer oceans lead to more surface evaporation, and warmer air is capable of carrying more moisture. When the warm air is forced upward by mountains, it cools and loses its ability to retain water, causing a sudden release of rain. With the Valencia floods, a year’s worth of rain fell in a single day. In North Carolina, upward of twelve to fourteen inches of rain fell in several hours. As global temperatures rise, outbursts of extreme precipitation will increase. Carl Renshaw, a hydrologist at Dartmouth, told me, referring to the meteorological conditions that led to the Texas floods, “You’re dumping so much water so quickly because you’ve primed the system with moisture. It’s like loading a gun. The people there had no time.”</p>
<p>Kerr County and its neighbor Kendall County sit in a valley that is known as Flash Flood Alley, because of the speed with which rainfall runs off the cliffs of the Balcones Escarpment and sluices down through streams and rivers to the coastal plain around San Antonio. The hillsides are steep, and the thin, dry topsoil over bedrock retains little water. Major flooding occurs regularly. And yet, even in Flash Flood Alley, which the judge of Kerr County, Rob Kelly, described in a press conference on July 4th as “the most dangerous river valley in the United States,” people continue to build in hundred-year floodplains. When properties are flooded, old-timers and newcomers alike tend to fix things back up. Kimberly Meitzen, a geography professor at Texas State University, in San Marcos, a small city in the Guadalupe River basin, told me, “We have this history of flooding and rebuilding here.” She mentioned five floods within living memory, in 1978, 1987, 1998, 2002, and 2015, in which not just houses but whole neighborhoods were washed away. “They just rebuild,” she said. Moreover, she added, “people continue to request variances to rebuild even closer” to the river. “There’s no really strong regulatory authority to prevent it,” she went on. “And so it just continues to put more people at risk.”</p>
<p>In Vermont, a flood in August, 2011, caused by <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hurricane-irene-and-global-warming-a-glimpse-of-the-future">Hurricane Irene</a>, was so devastating that the U.S. Geological Survey called it a five-hundred-year flood, and at least one analysis deemed it a thousand-year flood. The flood that tore through Plainfield on July 10, 2024, occurred one year to the day after the 2023 flood, which had been a hundred-year one. And, on the same day this July, a violent flood struck Caledonia County, in the north of the state. Although such a tight grouping of floods isn’t statistically impossible, it suggests that the probability curves used by <em>FEMA</em> are out of whack with real climate conditions.</p>
<p>A recent national study commissioned by First Street Foundation, a private risk-assessment firm, concluded that floods previously considered to be hundred-year events have become, on average, sixty-two-year events. (In some places, the estimate is as low as eight years.) The study also found that in Vermont’s Washington County, which includes Montpelier, Plainfield, and the city of Barre, more than forty-eight hundred properties (out of nearly thirty thousand total properties) are at high risk of flooding, yet <em>FEMA</em> includes fewer than fifteen hundred of those properties on its special-flood-hazard maps. Nationally, the study found that 17.7 million properties are at risk of flooding, but only about five million properties are in a <em>FEMA</em> flood-hazard zone. That means that millions of home buyers and owners are making decisions with an incomplete understanding of the true physical and financial risks they face. Jeremy Porter, the head of climate-implications research at First Street, told me, “Ultimately, what you end up doing is systematically underestimating flood risk.”</p>
<p>Vermont feels like the frontier of climate change in the Northeast. Farmers in the bottomlands, who previously planted wheat and barley, are beginning to plant rice, which can be underwater for two days without damage to the crop. The old roads that early Vermont settlers hacked out on hilltops, which lasted for more than two hundred years, are melting back into the forest. Extreme-rain events scour the roads down to bedrock ledges, rendering them impassable, and, because no one then uses them, any blown-down trees don’t get cleared. The next storm brings more blowdowns. A road that I went mountain biking on ten years ago, when it was a distinct pathway with old-growth trees on each side, lined by aged stone walls, is now such a tangle of fallen trees, branches, and rocks that it’s hard to tell a road was ever there.</p>
<p>Vermont is the second least populated state, after Wyoming, with fewer than six hundred and fifty thousand residents; it is also the fourth highest in disaster-relief funding per capita, nearly all of it flood-related. Washington County ranked first nationally in disaster declarations between 2011 and 2024. Annual precipitation in the state has increased six inches since the nineteen-sixties, and heavier-than-normal rain events in the Northeast are expected to increase by as much as fifty-two per cent by 2100. Vermont is a laboratory for the study of intense rainfall in steep terrain, and a proving ground for scientists, policymakers, regulators, and land-use planners who are on the front lines of a recurring catastrophe that traditional methods of prevention—dredging a river’s bottom, armoring its sides, berming its banks—have only made worse.</p>
<p>Kevin Geiger, a land-use planner with the Two Rivers-Ottauquechee Regional Commission, in Woodstock, Vermont, told me that the first step in designing a sustainable flood-prevention program is “believing that the flood will come.” He went on, “Until you do that, nothing else follows. Why would we tell a person they can’t build there? Why would a town need to have a rescue boat? Why would we put in a system with sirens, unless you believe in the flood?” He added, “But believing in the flood means being constantly worried. And that’s not a good condition. People don’t want to live that way.”</p>
<p>Geiger and I were driving west on Route 4, toward the town of Bridgewater. Like all Vermont roads, Route 4 is built to withstand twenty-five-year floods. In 2011 and again in 2023, the Ottauquechee River, now burbling charmingly just below the roadway, tore away large sections of this vital artery across central Vermont and wiped out homes and businesses. In 2011, the floodwaters sent the Dead River Company’s propane tanks hurtling downstream, where they leaked gas and tumbled over three dams. That year, the iron-truss bridge in Woodstock was destroyed and never rebuilt, and the covered bridge in Taftsville was severely damaged. The Quechee covered bridge had to be replaced.</p>
<p>Geiger pointed out structures near the river that won’t survive the next flood, or the one after that. “I’m like that kid in the movie who sees dead people,” he said, “except I see flooded houses. I just drive around and go, ‘Oh, that one’s a goner. It hasn’t happened yet, but . . .’ ” The only real solution, he said, was to buy those property owners out. In most such buyouts, <em>FEMA</em> will pay seventy-five per cent of the estimated pre-flood value of a property. About two hundred owners have taken buyouts in Vermont since Irene. (State and local agencies will usually make up the remaining twenty-five per cent.) But anyone who takes a buyout still needs to find housing, and Vermont is already dealing with an affordable-housing crisis that keeps young people from moving to the state. And buyouts mean that towns’ tax bases decrease, bringing in less money to apply to future floods. Bridgewater went more than five million dollars in debt from roadwork related to the 2023 flood. Although the town has finally begun to recover that money from <em>FEMA</em>, the six-per-cent interest it has been paying on its loan is not recoverable.</p>
<p>Before Geiger joined Two Rivers, he was briefly a firefighter in Zion National Park, in Utah, and he brings an emergency worker’s mind-set to flooding. “The fire department thinks your house is going to burn down, right?” he said. “The reason the fire department exists is they believe that things are going to burn.” But there is no equivalent of a fire department in flood response. That’s because, Geiger continued, “we don’t believe in floods the same way. We don’t practice for them.” He glanced over at the Ottauquechee. “Maybe it’s because fires don’t have a benign state like rivers do. Today the river is happy.”</p>
<p>Geiger went on, “Given the money that’s available, we can do a buyout here and there, or we could do a floodplain restoration, or maybe, you know, we could take out a bridge. But it’s nibbling at the problem.” He estimates that it would take thirty billion dollars to flood-proof Vermont, which would include moving crucial infrastructure away from the river and buying out hundreds if not thousands of property owners. “That’s moving a bunch of Montpelier and Barre,” he said. Only the federal government could afford that, and earlier this year President <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/flash-floods-and-climate-policy">threatened</a> to shut down <em>FEMA</em> and make the states responsible for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Geiger told me, “I say about these flooding events, ‘That wasn’t the movie. That was only the trailer. The movie is still in production.’ ”</p>
<p>Kerr County, like much of the Hill Country of central Texas, has grown steadily in population in recent years. Well-to-do families have attractive “river houses” with long green lawns that slope down to stands of cypress trees at the river’s edge. Visitors flock to barbecue joints, authentic country inns, and R.V. parks that are situated next to the river. At the HTR TX Hill Country campground, pitches for tents could be booked on a small island near the confluence of the north and south forks of the river. But all this development has often meant that riparian borders (in this case, the wooded land adjoining the river), which can slow a flood down, have been fragmented.</p>
<p>Subdivisions and housing developments have sprouted up, and more homes and businesses have been built in the floodplain. Many visitors, and newcomers who have bought vacation homes and invested in rental properties along the river, may well have had a limited understanding of the history of flooding in the upper basin; the last major flood in Kerrville occurred in 2002. After previous floods, some property owners put their houses on raised foundations and stilts, unwittingly making them even more vulnerable. On July 4th, the Guadalupe easily plucked these structures off their pillars.</p>
<p>Children’s summer camps are also situated all along the river’s upper basin. One of the oldest is Hunt’s Camp Mystic, founded in 1926. According to records from a state inspection on July 2nd, three hundred and eighty-six campers, and sixty-four counsellors, were staying in the camp’s Guadalupe location that week. Much of the camp property lies within <em>FEMA</em>’s hundred-year floodplain. The cabins for junior campers—the Bubble Inn, the Wiggle Inn, the Giggle Box, and the Twins I and II—were on lower-lying land, with some of them in a “floodway,” where new development is supposed to be severely restricted, and which Kerr County defines as “an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential.” Even so, Camp Mystic never had to reposition these cabins. (Indeed, as the Associated Press first reported, it made several successful appeals to <em>FEMA</em> to have some camp buildings removed from S.F.H.A. maps.)</p>
<p>Before the morning of July 4th, the upper river basin had experienced numerous floods, including the disaster in 1987, which killed ten teen-agers, whose bus was cut off by water while they were trying to flee a camp downriver, in Comfort, and the one in 2015, which killed thirteen people and wiped out much of the town of Wimberley, eighty miles east of Kerrville. And yet Judge Kelly, the county’s highest-ranking elected official, said in his July 4th remarks, “We had no reason to believe that this was going to be anything like what’s happened here, none whatsoever.”</p>
<p>“So, basically, a polycule is if you give an affair the energy of a co-op board meeting.”</p>

<p>The flash-flood warning that the National Weather Service sent at 1:14 <em>A.M.</em> on July 4th went over the Wireless Emergency Alerts system, which allows government agencies to push alerts to all major cellular carriers’ subscribers whose phones are in a designated area. Almost everyone with a cellphone in Kerr County should have received the message. Camp Mystic’s longtime executive director, Dick Eastland, got that alert, but the evacuation didn’t begin until 2:30 <em>A.M</em>.</p>
<p>Spotty cell coverage could explain why the warning at 1:14 and the upgraded emergency notification at 4:03 weren’t heeded by some Kerr County residents and officials. But even if the out-of-towners from <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/the-astonishing-transformation-of-austin">Austin</a>, Dallas, and beyond in the campgrounds along the river did receive these alerts on their phones, how many of them would have fully grasped the danger? According to the <em>Times</em>, the owner of the Blue Oak R.V. Park, Lorena Guillen, who bought the business four years ago, called the Kerr County sheriff’s office at 2:08 <em>A.M.</em> to ask if she should be concerned. She said that the person who answered the phone had no information about any flooding.</p>
<p>Many people simply ignored the warnings, or had their phones silenced or turned off. Larry Leitha, the sheriff of Kerr County, wasn’t awakened until around five-thirty. One commenter on <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/19/reddit-and-the-struggle-to-detoxify-the-internet%23:~:text=To%20its%20devotees,%20Reddit%20feels,and%20weirdest%20parts%20of%20humanity.%E2%80%9D">Reddit’s</a> Texas forum wrote after the flood, “We get so many ‘flash flood’ warnings which end up being water on the roadway that clears quickly after the rain stops. No one thought it meant 30 feet of water coming.” In addition to weather-related alerts, Texans receive Amber Alerts for missing children, Silver Alerts for missing seniors, Blue Alerts for suspects of violence against police, and <em>CLEAR</em> Alerts for missing adults in danger. Researchers have cautioned that people may become so desensitized to warnings that there’s no benefit to them. A 2024 <em>RAND</em> report found that thirty per cent of Texans opted out of emergency alerts, the highest rate in the nation. (Vermont had the lowest.) Kerr County has a Code<em>RED</em> alert system for emergencies, but emergency officials didn’t make use of it in time.</p>
<p>Sirens, on the other hand, do get people’s attention. Eighteen miles downriver from Kerrville, in the town of Comfort, where four hundred people lost their homes in the 1978 flood, a siren system was recently installed. On July 4th, the sirens sounded at 10:52 <em>A.M.</em>, giving people time to find higher ground. (They also had the added advantage of daylight and, for some, the knowledge of what was happening upstream.) “People knew that if they heard the siren, they gotta get out,” Danny Morales, the assistant chief of the Comfort Volunteer Fire Department, told NBC.</p>
<p>After the 2015 flood, Kerr County, which has an annual budget of sixty-seven million dollars, considered installing a siren system for the towns upriver. It would have cost the county about a million dollars. But, after much debate, county officials decided against it. One commissioner, H. A. (Buster) Baldwin, said in a 2016 meeting, “I think this whole thing is a little extravagant for Kerr County.” The potential noise bothered him. He went on, “The thought of our beautiful Kerr County having these damn sirens going off in the middle of the night—I’m going to have to start drinking again to put up with y’all.” Instead, Camp Mystic relied on a word-of-mouth warning system: camps upriver would phone those downriver if a flood was coming.</p>
<p>On a humid Saturday in late May, at the start of blackfly season in Vermont, I went to Plainfield to meet Mike Kline, a river scientist from nearby Middlesex, and George Springston, a local geologist who studies landslides. We walked along the Great Brook, the ordinarily placid and beguiling waterway that runs through the center of town. Of all the flood-damaged Vermont municipalities, Plainfield (population 1,236) is a poster child for the traditional, costly, and ultimately self-defeating flood-prevention practices. These include straightening and dredging rivers to allow for better navigation and more flow to power mills, and hardening the sides of streams and rivers with crushed stone and boulders known as riprap, to protect roads, railroad tracks, buildings, and other infrastructure from a river’s tendency to meander, which is what rivers in their natural state do. Rivers want to move; it’s part of the physics of flow and sediment transport. Unrestrained by human engineering, a river moves in a sinuous pattern that balances erosion and sedimentation.</p>
<p>But many rivers aren’t allowed to move laterally. They are straightened and “channelized” so that they remain in one place. During an extreme-rainfall event, the force of the water cascading down these straightened sluices meets with no resistance from meanders, and a river often has no way of reaching its floodplains—frequently now developed—which could absorb and store some runoff. The powerful flow scours valley walls, causing landslides, and finally inundates downstream places like Montpelier, Barre, and Waterbury, at which point it becomes the kind of flood you see on TV. Construction crews then re-dredge the river and re-armor its sides, insuring that the hydrological conditions that caused the flooding will be the same, or worse, the next time.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing here are the consequences of actions taken fifty years ago,” Springston said, “after the no-name flood of 1973.” That flood, coming after four relatively quiet decades, marked the beginning of the current era of extreme-precipitation events. Workers dredged the Great Brook afterward, using bulldozers to clear unsightly logjams (which can act as natural flood barriers), and rechannelled the stream. “I’ve told many folks,” Springston said, gesturing toward the wreckage, “this is payback from ’73. We’ve had a series of damaging floods since. We’re doing what doesn’t work over and over again.”</p>
<p>After the 2023 and 2024 floods, Vermont was able to muster the political will to break away from the traditional approach, and to begin managing its rivers in a more sustainable and less risky way. Mike Kline, more than anyone, is the man who made this happen. Kline is the driving force behind Vermont’s 2024 Flood Safety Act, a radical, first-in-the-nation law that gives the state jurisdiction over Vermont’s twenty-three thousand miles of streams and rivers. Beginning in 2028, when the new regulations take effect, Vermont’s rivers will be managed not as channels but as “corridors,” which will comprise all the land within the river’s natural meander pattern, plus fifty feet of riparian borders on both banks. The river will have the freedom to move and reconnect to floodplains. Riverside property owners will no longer have the automatic right to armor banks; in some cases they must allow the river to meander, even if that means it meanders through their land.</p>
<p>The river-corridor idea derived from what Kline calls a eureka moment, which he experienced in a river-science course he took in Colorado in 1999. The instructor had been discussing the concept of dynamic equilibrium in river management, which holds that healthy rivers with free meander patterns can achieve the right balance of sediment transport and riverbed stability to keep them from turning destructive. “I remember it very distinctly,” Kline said. “It’s, like, Oh, my gosh, if we can calculate all this mathematically, and it’s science-based, we can draw a river corridor and say, ‘Here’s our planning tool. This is how much room, at the minimum, the river needs to get to its least erosive form.’ ” He then spent the next twenty-five years trying to get Vermont land-use planners and lawmakers to listen to him. A lot of destruction had to occur first, but eventually they did.</p>
<p>I asked how the idea would work in practice, since so much critical infrastructure has been built in river corridors. Kline pointed to a spot where the Great Brook had eroded a large chunk of its bank. He told me, “If a landowner who owned this land said, ‘I want to come in and put my farm road back here and move the stream,’ they would be denied a permit. But as soon as there’s public infrastructure involved, or it’s a public-safety concern, the regulations get set aside.” Although the Flood Safety Act gives the state authority over river corridors, it also includes a provision that grants exceptions to the law in cases of compelling public interest. Kline said, “We didn’t think we had the political base to say that even the public infrastructure is subject to this law, and that, ultimately, it’s in society’s best interest to let this occur”—that is, to abandon the roads to the rivers.</p>
<p>Together with Springston, we continued walking along the Great Brook, which joins the Winooski River just south of the center of Plainfield. Springston pointed out debris that remained scattered around after last year’s flood. There was a concrete pipe that used to be part of the town’s sewage system, a section of a bridge that the stream had taken out, and the remains of the Heartbreak Hotel, a storied old apartment building, half of which washed into the river on the night of July 10th. The people living there got out in time, but their cats didn’t.</p>
<p>Both Kline and Kevin Geiger spoke about how Vermont’s recent series of floods have compressed geological time into human-scale time. Fluvial erosion has begun to form whole new valleys in spots like Plymouth, where Money Brook, previously a tiny rivulet, has sliced a deep trench in the hillside. But the most dramatic example of valley formation I saw was in Plainfield. The terrace on which the road out of town once sat was completely gone, and several hundred yards of road were gone with it. The brook had left its channel and begun a new channel across the valley. “It totally switched sides of the valley bottom,” Kline said, pleased. “This is the river corridor in action.”</p>
<p>The traditional approach to flooding in Vermont, which is to put the river and the road back in place and hope that the problem doesn’t return, was unthinkable in Plainfield. I have been in Vermont during all the major floods going back to ’73, and I’ve seen how violent normally gentle brooks can turn, but I had never seen anything like what we were looking at now, from the edge of a cliff where the road had been. This wasn’t just the trailer, to borrow Geiger’s analogy.</p>
<p>More than two dozen young girls and two counsellors are known to have died at Camp Mystic. All the girls were eight and nine years old. After finally deciding to evacuate, Dick Eastland, the camp’s executive director, and his son, Edward, had attempted to drive to the lowest-lying cabins to help, but the waters rapidly rose. Edward survived by clinging to a tree along with ten or so girls. His father was discovered in a car with three girls he’d been trying to save, and he died shortly afterward. No survivors from the Bubble Inn were found. Heartbreaking pictures of the flooded cabins showed stuffed animals that had escaped the torrent, though their owners hadn’t.</p>
<p>Over all, a hundred and thirty-five fatalities have been confirmed, more than a hundred of them in Kerr County alone, where three people are <a href="https://archive.is/o/GhkgU/https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-southwest/recovering-the-dead-in-texas-flash-flood-alley">still missing</a>. A sizable number of the victims were likely staying in the R.V. parks and campgrounds along the river. All thirty-three of the R.V.s in the Blue Oak park were taken by the river. Nearly everyone who was staying in the R.V.s managed to make it out, but four members of a family that was camping on the site’s island drowned. At the neighboring HTR TX Hill Country campground, more than twenty people died or were declared missing, many of them washed away in their R.V.s or in cabins.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, many questioned whether the cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the N.W.S. delayed the emergency response. Joe Friday, a former director of the N.W.S., wrote on Facebook that “the loss of senior, experienced people may have made it more difficult to get the information the ‘last mile’ to the individuals in danger.” The N.W.S.’s local warning-coördination meteorologist, Paul Yura, who had been pushed by <em>DOGE</em> into early retirement in April, would perhaps have been the person who made the officials of Kerr County realize that the rising waters were a big deal.</p>
<p>Meitzen, the Texas geography professor, told me that Vermont’s Flood Safety Act was “a great example of how so many of our river corridors across the nation, across the world, should be managed.” But the upper basin of the Guadalupe is almost all privately owned, and in Texas the property owner is king. “So that’s a really big challenge to land management in this environment,” she said. Some property owners might take buyouts, but people who earn a living from riverside vacation rentals would be giving up long-term income.</p>
<p>In Vermont, the rivers make their way through topsoil and clay, which are easily eroded by the movement of the water, but the Guadalupe’s meanders and straight reaches are entrenched in bedrock. Fluvial erosion, which Vermont’s river-corridor management is aimed at specifically, plays out in a different way in the upper basin. “I mean, these river valleys are carved by these large floods,” Meitzen said. “When you’re in the river valley, it’s full of giant boulders and cobbles that have been moved by large events. Those events form the rapids that everybody has so much fun playing on, and scour out the iconic pools that everybody likes to swing off of a cypress tree and jump into. These features are carved by these incredibly devastating events. People don’t understand that.” Flooding is an unavoidable part of the river’s life cycle, as is made clear in James C. Scott’s recent book, “In Praise of Floods.” Scott writes, “From a long-run hydrological perspective, it is just the river breathing deeply, as it must.” The question is, how do we live with floods in an era of climate change?</p>
<p>One measure, Meitzen said, would be to “remove buildings from the floodplain—residential houses, tourist houses, these camps, R.V. parks. Then we could help to really eliminate a lot of the loss of life that occurs during these events. But, you know, everybody’s talking about building back. ‘We will build back, we will rebuild.’ ”</p>
<p>A new, more accurate set of climate-related data is supposedly coming from <em>NOAA</em>, as part of its Atlas 15 project, which will presumably allow for a more realistic mapping of the risk of living near rivers throughout the United States. (Other risks, such as taking the subway in New York during the second-highest amount of rain in an hour ever recorded at Central Park, as occurred last week, will be harder to calculate.) Whether <em>FEMA</em> will even be around to deploy the maps is an open question. President Trump had previously said he would like to close the agency by the end of this year’s hurricane season.</p>
<p>For his part, the President has been calling the Texas floods “a hundred-year catastrophe.” On July 6th, he said, “They said once in a hundred years—they’ve never seen anything like this,” implying that there’s nothing anyone could have done, and that it won’t happen again in our lifetime. Until it does. ♦</p>
<h1 id="a-federal-trial-reveals-the-sprawling-plan-behind-trumps-attacks-on-"><strong>A Federal Trial Reveals the Sprawling Plan Behind Trump’s Attacks on …</strong></h1>
<p>By Cristian Farias</p>
<hr>
<p>In April, U.S. District Judge William Young, who sits in Boston, made a procedural ruling from the bench that seemed to catch the lawyers in the courtroom by surprise. Like many other judges these days, Young had convened a hearing to consider whether to grant a preliminary injunction—which, in the normal course, would put a quick stop to an illegal or otherwise unconstitutional government policy. By one count, in the first seventy days of <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>’s Presidency, forty-six judges across the country have issued this kind of order, preventing the Administration from forging ahead with its move-fast-and-break-things style of governance. The <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preliminary_injunction">purpose</a> behind these orders is to prevent imminent, irreparable harm to the plaintiffs and allow courts additional time to assess the legality of the challenged action.</p>
<p>But Judge Young had other ideas. “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a),” he announced in open court, “further hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction is combined with trial on the merits.” In other words, he wouldn’t simply grant short-term relief and kick the can down the road. There would be a trial, and it would happen fast—which meant that depositions, document productions, case-management conferences, and other minutiae would all go down in a couple of months’ time before proceedings began sometime in the summer. That choice set in motion what can be fairly described as the most consequential and far-reaching trial of the second Trump Presidency: American Association of University Professors et al. v. Marco Rubio—or A.A.U.P. v. Rubio, for short—challenges the Administration’s systematic campaign to arrest, disappear, detain, and deport pro-Palestinian student protesters and advocates.</p>
<p>The targets of this shocking crusade, all of them noncitizen visa holders or lawful permanent residents who have spoken out against the war in Gaza, are <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-radical-courage-of-noor-abdalla">well known</a> by now, some more than others: <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/24/the-case-of-mahmoud-khalil">Mahmoud Khalil,</a> Rümeysa Öztürk, Mohsen Mahdawi, Yunseo Chung, Badar Khan Suri. All of them landed on the government’s radar, and were pursued by <em>ICE</em>, at around the same time in March and April. All of them contend that the government sought to deport them on the basis of their constitutionally protected antiwar speech, and have won back or secured their freedom from immigration detention in the process. Yet this freedom—and their freedom to remain in the U.S.—is tenuous. The government still wants Khalil and the other students reincarcerated, back in immigration court, or else fighting for their chance to remain or study in the U.S. in highly complex legal proceedings.</p>
<p>For Khalil, Öztürk, and others, the truth about how and why <em>ICE</em> hunted them down has been somewhat elusive. They and their lawyers know what the rest of us know: they’re the public faces of a campaign against pro-Palestinian student protesters that’s part of a much broader assault on the First Amendment and higher education itself. The Administration, for its part, has been brutally honest about its intentions: “This is the first arrest of many to come,” Trump <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114139222625284782">wrote</a> on Truth Social, two days after Khalil, a Syrian-born Algerian citizen who was about to graduate from Columbia University, was apprehended. Pointing to “this Administration’s policy,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, later said that participating in “anti-American, antisemitic, pro-Hamas protest will not be tolerated,” and that the Department of Homeland Security was “using intelligence” to identify students who did. Rubio, the Secretary of State, meanwhile, has been personally signing off on visa and green-card revocations through a little-used authority granted to him under immigration laws. After Öztürk, a Turkish national in her fifth year as a doctoral student at Tufts University, was arrested, following an op-ed she wrote, Rubio acknowledged that he was behind her detention. “At some point I hope we run out because we’ve gotten rid of all of them,” he said. “But we’re looking every day for these lunatics that are tearing things up.” This openness isn’t lost on Judge Young. “The government isn’t acting secretly here,” he <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/yy1d9fewxg">said</a> in court. “One thing that can be said is the government’s pretty forthright about what it’s doing.”</p>
<p>But the students targeted by the Administration, to this day, do not fully know what the government knows, such as how they ended up on a blacklist that was then acted on by the State Department and other immigration authorities. Nor do they know how agents of the state, either in the field or from an office in Washington, D.C., decided to single them out, and then proceeded with their detention and attempted deportation. There has also been no official account of the chilling effect that this coördinated approach has had on scores of other international students, scholars, and academics who now feel they must self-censor, retreat from public life, scrub their online presence, or refrain from protest activity. That is the focus of A.A.U.P. v. Rubio, which was brought not by Khalil and the other students who have been singled out by the Administration but, rather, by the people who fear they will be next in the line of fire. The trial matters because, for the first time, this wealth of truth, much of it in the government’s possession, and its broader effects are coming to light in ways they wouldn’t have otherwise—let alone in piecemeal litigation, habeas proceedings, or else in faraway immigration courts, where the process itself, as Khalil and his legal team know well, is a form of punishment. As court records in the students’ parallel cases against the Administration illustrate, these are forums where cases might not <em>ever</em> go to trial.</p>
<p>Judge Young <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/judge-william-young/id1704723428?i=1000628466654">loves</a> trials. As he put it when he decided to have one in this case, “Trials reach out for justice . . . in the best way that humankind knows. That’s what I want. I want a trial. You’ve given me the basis to order one. I am.”</p>
<p>Because this is a bench trial, rendering Judge Young—rather than a jury—the sole arbiter of the facts and the law, he has made it plain that it’s not his intention to relitigate any of the student cases, or else meddle with the work of the other judges handling them. “I don’t instruct other judges,” he said, early in the trial. He has run a tight ship, keeping to strict time limits (four and a half days of testimony per side), and staying focussed on the issues at hand, namely who did what and when during the implementation of the government’s policy of rounding up pro-Palestininan student advocates for deportation; proof of how the plaintiff organizations’ First Amendment rights, and those of noncitizen members, have been violated; and evidence that shows the government is liable for those harms. Down the line, the judge will consider what kind of remedy he can order, if necessary.</p>
<p>Unlike the student protesters, all of whom have legal standing to bring their own cases against the government for their suffering, the plaintiffs here—the American Association of University Professors, three of its chapters, and the Middle East Studies Association—allege a different kind of harm: their inability to fully exercise their right to teach, write, organize, and collaborate with one another, as scholars often do in their various fields, because doing so would put them in the sights of the Administration. (The case was filed by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. Since May, I have hosted a podcast, “<a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bullys-pulpit-trump-v-the-first-amendment/id1813437044">The Bully’s Pulpit</a>,” produced by the institute, but I have no connection to its legal team.) Some of them have unique ties to Khalil and the students who have been targeted. Nadia Abu El-Haj, a professor at Columbia, spoke of how Mahdawi, a Palestinian refugee who was studying at the university, told her that he had a feeling he was next after Khalil’s arrest: “He asked me to convince the Columbia University president to move him from his Columbia housing that was off campus to inside the gates, because at that point the university was requiring a judicial warrant for <em>ICE</em> agents to enter the gates of Columbia, and the properties outside were less secure.” (Ultimately, Mahdawi was arrested by <em>ICE</em> in Vermont, after travelling to the state for a scheduled naturalization interview. He was freed just in time for his graduation in May.)</p>
<p>The government, still committed to the students’ deportations, has objected strenuously to having any recollections of private conversations with the likes of Mahdawi or Öztürk admitted into the record—such as when Öztürk, shortly before her arrest, showed up at her academic adviser’s office, clearly distraught, after seeing her <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://canarymission.org/individual/Rumeysa_Ozturk">profile</a> on the website for Canary Mission, the anonymously run pro-Israel organization that, as many have suspected and the trial has finally confirmed, fed names to the Administration’s operation against pro-Palestininan students. Young wouldn’t let the contents of the conversation into evidence, but Öztürk’s adviser at Tufts, Sara Johnson, did get to describe the effect this doxing had on her and her student: “Her eyes were red. Her face was puffy. She was clearly trying to hold back tears with a fistful of Kleenex.”</p>
<p>The extent to which the Administration acted on close to five thousand tips from Canary Mission and from Betar U.S., another pro-Israel group, which together have compiled thousands of profiles of pro-Palestinian students, has emerged as a major pillar of the plaintiffs’ case. Peter Hatch, an assistant director of intelligence at <em>ICE</em>’s Homeland Security Investigations, testified on the third day of the trial that “most” of the names came from Canary Mission. “We received information on the same protester from multiple sources, but Canary Mission was the most inclusive,” he said. The volume of names was such that the government created a “tiger team”—a term of art in the federal government—of intelligence analysts to process the names of protesters expeditiously to create “reports of analysis” on upward of a hundred of them, which would then be shared with the State Department for further action. The reports for Khalil, Öztürk, and the other students were admitted into evidence and shown in open court for the first time—up to that point, the government had never disclosed them, despite the students’ lawyers having <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.639187/gov.uscourts.nysd.639187.60.0.pdf">asked</a> for the reports and other relevant documents in litigation.</p>
<p>By now, there’s little doubt that this effort was a carefully orchestrated policy, involving multiple components in different agencies. Yet the higher the official was in the chain of command, the greater their resistance to admitting that there was one. John Armstrong, the head of the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs and the person who signed off on “action memos” for Rubio to carry out—including those which involved four of the five students—adamantly denied his operation was anything akin to an ideological deportation policy. “At the end of the day, the buck stops with me,” he said on the fifth day of trial. “I would know if there was an ideological deportation policy going on that involved the Bureau of Consular Affairs. It’s silly to suggest that there’s such a policy that I wouldn’t know about.”</p>
<p>But is any of this silly? And, if it is, why has the government fought so vigilantly to keep a number of documents and other evidence secret? Not long before Armstrong made that statement, the government attempted to clear the courtroom so that Armstrong would testify to a “confidential” document already in evidence. Young wouldn’t have any of it. “There’s a constitutional right to have a public courtroom for public trials,” he said. And, while another State Department official testified that same day, the government invoked the Presidential-communications privilege to not disclose the identities of members of the Homeland Security Council, which is part of the Executive Office of the President. “Its membership is secret?” Young asked. “I may not know who these people are? . . . Is that what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>The government insisted that the names were privileged, although it is not a stretch to imagine that Stephen Miller, Trump’s right-hand adviser on immigration, was one of them. As <em>Politico</em> <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/09/pro-palestinian-deportation-documents-trial-00445238">reported</a>, in unsealed court records of the trial, Armstrong had revealed under oath that he’d had “at least a dozen” meetings with Trump’s inner circle about these cases, and that Miller was part of conference calls involving the Homeland Security Council and other agencies “at one point at least weekly.” Yet how hands-on Miller was remains something of a mystery—as does the contents of Exhibit A, another document over which the government has <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.282460/gov.uscourts.mad.282460.190.4.pdf">invoked</a> the Presidential-communications privilege. Whatever its contents, the name of the document, which was sent from the State Department to the White House in March, bears all the hallmarks of policymaking, or a policy in the making: “Report on Department of State Authorities to Counter Anti-Semitism and Recommendations for Familiarizing Institutions of Higher Education with the Security and Related Grounds for Visa Inadmissibility.”</p>
<p>Besides, whatever decisions the White House made or didn’t make are made somewhat clearer by evidence from others further down the chain: as one senior <em>ICE</em> official, Andre Watson, testified last Thursday, he personally signed off on letters recommending that the State Department revoke the visas of the targeted students, or otherwise mark them for deportation. In Khalil’s case, Watson acknowledged that his letter to State was sent one day before <em>ICE</em> arrested Khalil at his Columbia residence. (Watson has been busy with other litigation challenging the chaos brought about by the sudden termination of scores of student-visa records across the country.) And then there’s the supervisory <em>ICE</em> official who, in a moment of candor, told the court that “there were a lot of hands in the fishbowl” in the operation to nab Öztürk near her home in Somerville, Massachusetts. He also said that he couldn’t “recall receiving a communication” from a higher-up instructing him to take action in a case like the Tufts student’s—all but admitting that arresting a student over an opinion piece in her student newspaper is not standard agency protocol.</p>
<p>On the final full day of testimony, on Friday, Armstrong returned to the stand, this time virtually, and gave away the game. For one, he conceded that his office, which plays a key role in revoking student visas, has been operating without a working definition of “antisemitism.” In effect, this means that chants such as “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” or denouncing Zionism, or calling for an arms embargo on Israel, among other common activist demands, could be grounds for a revocation. This definitional vacuum prompted Young to ask Armstrong for his personal definition. “In my opinion, antisemitism is unjustified views, biases, or prejudices, or actions against Jewish people, or Israel, that are the result of hatred toward them,” he said.</p>
<p>Far more striking was the revelation that Armstrong, in the case of Mahdawi, warned Rubio that revoking the student’s lawful status over his protest activities, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, could result in a legal challenge down the line. “Given the potential that a court may consider his actions inextricably tied to speech protected under the First Amendment, it is likely that courts will closely scrutinize the basis for this determination,” Armstrong wrote to Rubio in mid-March; Rubio approved the revocation the same day. In the case of Öztürk, for whom a D.H.S. assessment had found no evidence of antisemitic conduct or support for a terrorist organization, Armstrong didn’t go to Rubio but instead made the decision to revoke her visa himself. “I thought long and hard about Ms. Öztürk’s case,” he said.</p>
<p>The trial ended on Monday. During the government’s closing argument, it alluded to “<a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://www.amazon.com/Don-Quixote-Miguel-Cervantes/dp/0060934344/">Don Quixote</a>,” suggesting that the academic organizations’ case was a pursuit of an imaginary enemy akin to Cervantes’s hero’s attempt to attack windmills that he has mistaken for giants. In response, Young compared Trump to Henry II, whose musing “Can someone rid me of this nettlesome priest?,” though not an overt order, famously prompted four “errant knights” to assassinate the clergyman who vexed the king. The President, Young said, “doesn’t have errant knights, but he has Stephen Miller.” Trump, he went on, “certainly brilliantly uses his right to free speech. Whether he recognizes or not whether other people have any right to free speech is questionable.”</p>
<p>As Young has indicated more than once, the case is now “under advisement”—judge-speak for taking an unspecified amount of time to deliberate and rule. Expect a voluminous, thoughtful decision: in another Trump 2.0 case dealing with substantial funding cuts to scientific research, which Young declared unlawful last month, his written <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://www.aclu.org/documents/apha-v-nih-findings-of-fact-ruling-of-law-and-order-for-partial-separate-and-final-judgement">ruling</a> ran a hundred and three pages. That was after a one-day trial. (In a courtroom not far from Young’s, on Monday, lawyers for the Trump Administration squared off with Harvard University over its own First Amendment challenge to more than two billion dollars in research-funding cuts; there, as in the A.A.U.P. case, the government is wielding antisemitism as a cudgel to justify its actions.)</p>
<p>Should Young strike down the policy and find the government liable, his next job will be to craft a remedy, which will have to be forward-looking—he can’t touch the student cases. Yet the fact that a number of noncitizen academics were able to take the stand at all, without fear of repercussions from the government, offers a window into the kind of relief that’s within the judge’s reach. Ahead of trial, and despite the government’s opposition, Young <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/b17bqsu8m5">ordered</a> that no one taking the stand be subject to adverse immigration consequences—in effect, a witness-protection program not by the government but <em>from</em> it. Might the judge be able to restore their freedom to speak outside the courtroom?</p>
<p>Two of the noncitizen scholars who benefitted from this protective order—Megan Hyska, who is Canadian, and Nadje Al-Ali, who grew up in Germany with a German mother and an Iraqi father—testified at length about what watching and internalizing the harrowing viral videos of Khalil and Öztürk getting ambushed by <em>ICE</em> did to their lives and careers. They spoke about how their own freedom to write and teach and participate in conferences abroad came to a standstill. They spoke about the cancelled trips and postponed academic fellowships, for fear that the government might not let them back into the U.S. And they spoke about how they saw themselves, and their own students, in those videos. “I know about dictatorship and repression and my relatives in Iraq lived with that fear of being picked up from the street,” Al-Ali <a href="https://archive.is/o/4YVUG/https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/vor6rco7dh">testified</a>. “So it really reminded me of that.” ♦</p>

<p>By Rachel Aviv</p>
<hr>
<p>When Christine was nine years old, her mother, Mary, said, “Come here. I want to tell you a secret.” They sat on a brown couch in their living room, in Santa Ana, California. Mary, who was forty-three, said that a man she had known in medical school, a professor, was sending her messages about a plan to take her away and live in a mansion together. “I remember feeling really excited, because that fit with my sense of what should be happening,” Christine said. “I was really into ‘Harry Potter’ and the idea that, if you are part of the select, you can see a bigger story happening out there.”</p>
<p>Mary leaned over and began separating strands of Christine’s hair, as if searching for lice. “Does he put listening devices in your hair?” Mary asked, about the professor. “Does he ever ask you to say things to me?”</p>
<p>Christine, the older of two sisters, said, “I believed everything she said until she accused me of something that I knew wasn’t true.” Mary had always been tender and doting and practical, and, Christine said, “I just had this feeling in my body that she was not the same.”</p>
<p>Her sister, Angie, who is seven years younger, learned to follow their mother’s instructions, whether or not they made sense. “I was taught the rules of her delusions at the same time as I was taught other rules and norms about the world,” Angie said. She came to view her mother’s stories about the professor, and about friends who were part of his mission, as akin to tales in the Bible. “It’s kind of like, O.K., some of these people are real, and some of these people aren’t real,” she said.</p>
<p>Christine was often cast in the role of the villain. Her mother would yell at her for poisoning her pizza or hiding her keys or other menacing deeds, even as Christine tried to explain that she hadn’t done them. Sometimes Mary smacked her. (Mary doesn’t remember this.) Christine began to mistrust her own memory, too. “My mom would accuse me of things, and then I’d be, like, Maybe I did do these things,” she said. In fifth grade, she asked Santa Claus for a polygraph machine. “I just had this baseline sense of: I could be doubted at any time.”</p>
<p>She felt that people might help her mother if she could just find the right language to describe her transformation. By high school, she was spending so much time studying the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> that she texted a friend that she had actually “married the dsm-iv.” She explained that her mother suffered from the “fregoli delusion,” a belief that strangers were disguised as doubles of people she knew. In her journal, Christine wrote, “My mom has erotomanic delusion disorder with a splash of persecutory delusions.” She asked for help from teachers and a school counsellor, but, she said, the “message I got was, basically, Everybody has their shit, and you have to just deal with it and keep getting good grades.”</p>
<p>Angie has no memories of Mary before her psychosis, but Christine remembers her as a “magical, glowing figure.”Photograph courtesy the family</p>
<p>Mary, who was from India and had worked as a physician there for a decade, spoke so much about the professor that her husband, Chris, who worked at the California Department of Motor Vehicles, eventually found the professor’s number and called him. “He said, ‘I am not in contact with her,’ ” Chris recalled. “ ‘I didn’t even know your wife came to America.’ ” At the professor’s suggestion, Chris scheduled an appointment for Mary with a psychiatrist. Christine sat in the waiting room, hoping that this would be the beginning of getting back the mother of her early childhood, whom she remembered as a “magical, glowing figure.” But when Mary finished the appointment she said that the psychiatrist thought she was fine. Not long afterward, Mary kicked Chris out of the apartment and barricaded the door with a desk and two heavy suitcases. Christine and Angie allotted extra time to get to school each morning so they could remove the obstacles.</p>
<p>Karl Jaspers, the German psychiatrist and philosopher, has described what he calls the “delusional atmosphere,” a profound alteration in the way certain people experience the world. “There is some change which envelops everything with a subtle, pervasive and strangely uncertain light,” he wrote. People in this state search for a story that explains why everything suddenly feels uncanny and ominous. The “vagueness of content must be unbearable,” he wrote. “To reach some definite idea at last is like being relieved from some enormous burden.”</p>
<p>Mary had landed on a story that overwrote the reality of her daughters’ lives, but they also recognized in it a kind of emotional logic. Mary had been pressured to marry Chris, in an arranged match, and, when they settled in America, he had traditional ideas about a woman’s role and restricted her freedom to pursue her career. Christine and Angie came to feel that their mother’s delusions—that her former colleagues would free her from marriage and she’d be restored to her place in the medical community—were “a way of explaining how she ended up trapped in this position,” Christine said. “We theorized that psychosis was almost a reasonable response.”</p>
<p>Christine moved to New York after high school, because her favorite book, “Underworld,” by Don DeLillo, was set there, and because it seemed like the city where people went to escape their homes. She lived in the Bronx, near her father’s brother, and got a job at Planet Hollywood. She wanted to be a novelist, and obsessively re-read “Underworld,” covering the pages with determined annotations: “integrated dialogue”; “meta commentary”; “sensation of young immediacy.”</p>
<p>Angie and her mother would text Christine asking for groceries or pizza, and she would order the food for them from across the country. Mary was still barricading the door. Chris slept in his car. (Eventually, he moved in with a girlfriend.) Christine worried that Angie, who was eleven, was growing up in a kind of folie à deux, a delusional system that structures two lives. Angie said, of her mother, “I could never figure out why she was doing these things to me, and I had this kind of emotional explanation: Other things are just more important to her. I’m only there as a vessel for the magical thinking.” After about a year, Christine arranged for her mother and Angie to move to New York, too. (Mary asked me to use only her middle name, to protect her privacy.)</p>
<p>Mary moved into an apartment in the Bronx, in the same building as her brother-in-law, and plastered the walls with tape, to prevent reality-TV shows from recording her and Angie through the cracks. Angie tried to bathe while her mother was asleep because Mary believed there was a camera in the showerhead, and had covered it with a sock. Angie felt as if she were living in a kind of urban version of “Grey Gardens,” a formative movie for her. The documentary chronicles the lives of a mother and daughter, relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who live together for years, piles of trash accumulating around them, social conventions becoming remote.</p>
<p>After two years in New York, Mary seemed increasingly unable to care for herself, so Christine, who had enrolled at Columbia, called the city’s mobile crisis unit, a team that assesses people in psychiatric distress. The crisis unit knocked on Mary’s door, and, after a conversation in which she described receiving electric transmissions through a filling in her tooth, she was admitted to Mount Sinai Beth Israel hospital, in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists there petitioned a judge for permission to hospitalize her for a month and treat her with antipsychotics, over her objections. “I believe that she has no judgment concerning the nature of her illness,” one of them wrote. On an evaluation form, another psychiatrist initially wrote that Mary had an “unspecified psychotic disorder.” Then, perhaps uncomfortable with such a vague diagnosis, she crossed out the phrase and wrote, “Schizophrenia.” Mary was fifty-five years old, and her symptoms had begun in her early forties, which is unusual for schizophrenia. Most people are diagnosed in their twenties or early thirties.</p>
<p>Christine moved into her mother’s apartment and filed a petition for joint custody of Angie. Their father, who was living in California, did not contest the petition. “I make breakfast in the morning,” Christine wrote in her journal, describing her new routine with Angie. “I wash the dishes. I lock the door at night. I have established, kicking and screaming, my own rightful place as an active agent in the universe.”</p>
<p>When Mary was released from the hospital, she stopped taking her medications. Neither she nor her daughters thought they had helped her. For about a third of people with schizophrenia, antipsychotics do not work. “I wish my mother’s delusions and paranoia were treatable,” Angie wrote, in a college-application essay. “However, she has lived with them for 12 years, and her institutionalization last year had no effect.”</p>
<p>Mary’s admission to Beth Israel was the beginning of a nine-year cycle in which she was sent to psychiatric hospitals for weeks at a time before being released, unchanged. Mary said that each time she was admitted to a hospital the staff “kept asking the same questions, and it never made anybody have a different outlook on the situation. Everyone stayed with the same thing. It was schizophrenia.”</p>
<p>After five hospital stays, including one in which the police led her to an ambulance in handcuffs because she wouldn’t leave her apartment, Mary was transferred to the Bronx Psychiatric Center, a state facility that provides long-term care. She observed that when patients refused medications staff would sometimes call security, and the patients would be injected with drugs, a prospect that terrified her. “I would take the medication without any question, because I’m not risking fighting with security,” she told me. “These people are very sensitive to what they call ‘challenging authority.’ ” She spent her days dreading the moment when she’d be forced to swallow her pills.</p>
<p>Mary sometimes imagined that God had a reason for keeping her in the hospital, but, she said, “I did not even want to go there, because the reasoning mind makes you feel very nervous and uncertain.” Her daily life became so narrow that she stopped noticing the weather. “They don’t remind you about the changing season—that spring is coming into summer or the winter is coming into spring,” she said. “You just pass the days as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Christine, who spoke to her mother every week, said that Mary never articulated her sorrow at the time. “I would have wanted to engage on the level of ‘I’m sorry you’re there, do you feel sad?’ And I’m sure she was having those emotions, but she wasn’t able to express them. It was always ‘I’m being attacked. I’m being held like a prisoner here.’ ” Christine felt that her mother was safer at the Bronx Psychiatric Center than she would be anywhere else, but she felt guilty for hoping that Mary would stay there for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Mary was discharged in September, 2023, after a year. A week later, she collapsed in her bathroom and struggled to move. She was taken to a hospital in Brooklyn, where the doctors told her to stop taking antipsychotics, because they thought her condition may have been a side effect of the drugs. Then they discovered that she actually had lymphoma, a sometimes fatal form of cancer. She began seven cycles of a treatment that combined chemotherapy with rituximab, a medication that targets antibodies involved in the body’s immune response.</p>
<p>When Christine and Angie visited her at the hospital, Mary responded to their questions with one-word answers. Her face had a vacant expression. Christine and Angie thought she was dying. Mary did, too. She dreamed about being a child, playing with her sister and four brothers, in Kolkata, where she grew up. “I told myself, ‘This must be the end of it,’ ” Mary said.</p>
<p>Angie, who was now twenty-two and had recently graduated from Dartmouth, prepared in therapy for her mother’s death. She said, “I had multiple sessions where I was just crying about the fundamental things I wish she had given me, like ‘I wish she could have told me what was going on in her head,’ or ‘I wish she could have told me she was sorry for what she did.’ ”</p>
<p>By Christmas, two months after beginning chemotherapy, Mary was moving a little more freely, and she had begun to carry on conversations. Christine and Angie noticed that her personality seemed different: she was calm, outgoing, and polite, and she often expressed gratitude. Angie texted Christine that Mary seemed peaceful, as if maybe she was “getting some post-life or death clarity?”</p>
<p>Christine, who was twenty-nine and had settled in London, having moved there for a master’s degree in psychology, was struck by her mother’s ability to watch the news and absorb the information on its own terms. For years, the television had been a source of agitation; Mary had said that people were using her ideas and repeating her lines.</p>
<p>“I was responsible for one of the largest back yards in the country.”</p>

<p>One day, when Christine was visiting the hospital, Mary asked for a phone. “I sort of teased her, ‘Now you’re asking for a phone?’ ” Christine said. “I wasn’t really making much of it, but then afterward I thought, Why has she asked for a phone? That’s quite unusual.” Mary already had a phone, but it was in storage because she’d told Christine that it contained spyware.</p>
<p>Angie gave her a flip phone and, to be safe, covered the camera with a piece of tape. “She seemed fine using it, which was odd,” Angie said.</p>
<p>In May, a month after Mary finished chemotherapy, Christine and Angie asked a psychiatrist at the hospital to examine her. Christine said, “The psychiatrist was, like, ‘Why have you called me here? I don’t understand. She has no symptoms.’ And we were, like, ‘Yeah, that’s the reason we’ve called you here.’ ”</p>
<p>Christine had the same feeling in her body that she’d had when her mother first became ill—the sense that something at Mary’s core had changed. She tried to get the doctors to grasp the scale of her mother’s recovery. By the summer, her cancer was in remission. She hadn’t taken antipsychotics for months, and yet “her psychotic symptoms are gone,” a doctor wrote. Christine told the doctors, “She had a twenty-year psychiatric history. Have you heard of this? Could any of her medications have caused this?” She spoke with a neurologist at the hospital, but he didn’t have an answer. Omid Heravi, one of Mary’s oncologists, didn’t understand what had happened, either. “Medicine is very specialized—we don’t get involved in other fields,” he said. He guessed only that one of the cancer drugs she’d been given had had collateral benefits. “In medicine, all side effects are not bad,” he offered.</p>
<p>When a person recovers from an illness, it is usually seen as the end of the story. But becoming sane also causes a kind of narrative collapse, a confrontation with a personal history that is no longer recognizable. Christine encouraged her mother’s friends and siblings, whom she’d been estranged from for years, to get back in touch. She wanted to restore her mother’s sense of connection, but, she said, “I also wanted them to be able to tell me—outside of my childhood memories—if this is the person she used to be.”</p>
<p>For years, Christine’s friends had known little about her mother beyond the details of her mental illness. “Suddenly, I was, like, ‘Hey, my mom’s better now. Would you like to call her up and talk to her?’ And that was a shocking concept for them,” she said. “I mean, there are a lot of people who wouldn’t necessarily be open to jumping on a call without planning, but my mom was now the type of person who is quite flexible and responsive and conversationally fluid.” Christine described her as a “psychological débutante.”</p>
<p>Angie, who was living in Queens and working at a firm where she analyzed data on sexual violence, felt skeptical that their mother’s transformation was real. Christine said, “I felt like, If Mom can disappear, then she can come back.” But Angie didn’t have memories of Mary from before the illness, and it felt to her like she was being asked to believe that her mother had become a new person. “I tend to choose security over the process of discovery,” Angie told me. “I didn’t have a curiosity that felt worth the emotional risks.” Angie had always felt that, on some level, her mother had “chosen her delusions” over her children. She didn’t want to experience that choice being made again.</p>
<p>Christine searched for medical papers that might explain her mother’s recovery and allow Angie to believe in it. She read about each of the medications that her mother had taken and concluded that the key drug may have been rituximab, the immunosuppressant. “I have a new working theory,” she texted Angie, in May, 2024. “Theoretically her chemo could have incidentally cured” her.</p>
<p>Christine found a handful of recent case studies that documented drastic psychiatric recoveries after people were treated with drugs that dampen immune activity. A 2017 study in <em>Frontiers in Psychiatry</em> described a woman with a twenty-five-year history of schizophrenia. She also had a skin disease, for which she was given drugs that reduced inflammation and suppressed her immune response. Her doctors noticed a pattern: when they treated her skin lesions, her psychosis went away. They hypothesized that the rash and the psychosis had been caused by a single autoimmune disorder, and were cured by the same drugs. Another paper in <em>Frontiers in Psychiatry</em> described a man with “treatment-resistant schizophrenia” who developed leukemia. After a bone-marrow transplant, which reconstituted his immune system, he startled his doctors by suddenly becoming sane. Eight years later, the authors wrote, “the patient is very well and there are no residual psychiatric symptoms.”</p>
<p>Christine also discovered a Washington <em>Post</em> article from 2023 about a woman named April, who had fallen into a catatonic state at the age of twenty-one and been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Sander Markx, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia, first encountered April at a psychiatric hospital on Long Island when he was a medical student; twenty years later, he was dismayed to find her at the same hospital, in the same condition. “She has not been outside for twenty years—out of sight,” he said, at a symposium at Weill Cornell’s medical school. He and his colleagues gave her an extensive workup and found that she had lupus, an autoimmune disorder that, in rare cases, can induce inflammation in the brain, causing symptoms that are indistinguishable from those of schizophrenia. After undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, including rituximab, April emerged from, essentially, a “twenty-five-year-long coma, and was able to tell us everything,” Markx said. “We don’t have a script for this. We don’t see patients coming back from this condition.”</p>
<p>April’s case helped give momentum to the founding, in 2023, of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation (S.N.F.) Center for Precision Psychiatry and Mental Health, at Columbia, which is working to uncover biologically distinct subtypes of illness that have been obscured by the broad categories in the <em>DSM.</em> Christine sent an e-mail to Markx, a co-director of the S.N.F. Center, with a brief time line of her mother’s life. “Her psychiatric symptoms disappeared and have yet to resurface months later,” she wrote. “But her current clinicians are stumped as to why it has happened.” When Markx didn’t respond, Christine, who was visiting New York, decided that she and Angie should go to Columbia to introduce themselves in person. Markx wasn’t in his office—he had just begun an ongoing medical leave—but they slipped a handwritten card in a pink envelope under his door and used inter-campus mail to send cards to the other directors of the center. They tried to think of this step, Angie said, as “the part in the documentary where the cameras go all shaky and you get the sense that someone is about to break a hole in the case.”</p>
<p>Emil Kraepelin, who developed psychiatry’s first modern diagnostic system, in the eighteen-nineties, defined the disease we now know as schizophrenia largely in terms of its hopelessness. The diagnosis allowed hospital administrators to separate patients with “periodic insanities” (like depression and bipolar disorder) from those who were believed to be incurable and belonged in asylums. Kraepelin hoped that schizophrenia would eventually reveal itself to be a disease like neurosyphilis, which was then responsible for a large portion of the cases of insanity in psychiatry wards. In 1913, scientists demonstrated that bacteria had infected the brains of these patients. “The diseases produced by syphilis are an object lesson,” Kraepelin wrote, four years later. “It is logical to assume that we shall succeed in uncovering the causes of many other types of insanity that can be prevented—perhaps even cured—though at present we have not the slightest clue.”</p>
<p>Psychiatry and neurology were originally one medical discipline, but gradually neurologists took responsibility for diseases like neurosyphilis and dementia, in which the pathology could be seen in an autopsied brain, and psychiatrists handled the illnesses that were left behind, their causes still a mystery. Schizophrenia, which affects roughly one per cent of the population, became the disorder through which psychiatry worked out its identity, in part because it seemed to embody the mystery and intractability of madness, presenting basic questions about what it means to have a self. “The history of modern psychiatry is, in fact, practically synonymous with the history of schizophrenia, the quintessential form of madness in our time,” the psychologist Louis Sass has written.</p>
<p>But psychiatrists struggled to pinpoint a single feature that unified the diagnosis. “The great question is what is this ‘something’ that underlies the symptoms,” Karl Jaspers wrote, in 1963. Three decades later, the psychiatrist Ian Brockington warned that the obsession with schizophrenia had stifled clinical curiosity. “Smaller, more homogeneous entities have been sucked in by the gravity of the big idea, and annihilated,” he wrote. For decades, scientists have been searching in vain for a biological marker that would confirm whether someone has schizophrenia. Last year, in a paper in <em>Schizophrenia Research</em>, seventeen international experts concluded that schizophrenia was defined by no single etiology, symptom, or biological mechanism. “It is prudent to wonder if the construct around which we are organizing this information is fundamentally flawed,” the authors wrote.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most vivid disruption to the idea of schizophrenia as a monolithic concept began in 2007, when Josep Dalmau, a neurologist at the University of Barcelona, started publishing papers with his colleagues which described young patients with delusions, hallucinations, and sudden changes in their behavior, like agitation and inappropriate giggling. Within days or weeks, they deteriorated, developing seizures, losing consciousness, or struggling to breathe. Dalmau discovered that they had a form of encephalitis, inflammation of the brain. Their immune systems had misidentified the NMDA receptor—a protein in the brain that affects mood and memory—as foreign and produced antibodies that attacked it. When these patients were treated with immunotherapy, the majority of them recovered completely, sometimes within a month.</p>
<p>Thomas Pollak, a neuropsychiatrist at King’s College London and the Maudsley Hospital, told me that treating patients with the condition was “revelatory and disquieting, because some of them looked exactly like the people I’d been seeing in the psychiatry ward. It was uncanny to see that a presumably totally different pathway could lead to this.” Their illness, which was named anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis, usually began in their early twenties, just as schizophrenia often does. The discovery of the illness put pressure on the artificial division between psychiatry and neurology—the only two fields of medicine that focus on the same organ. “Many of the symptoms are shared, but we are using different words,” Pollak said.</p>
<p>In “Brain on Fire,” a memoir from 2012, the journalist Susannah Cahalan—the two hundred and seventeenth person in the world to be diagnosed with anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis—describes how for a month, in which she swung between paranoid aggression and euphoria, some doctors treated her as if she were just a difficult psychiatric patient who drank too much. “If it took so long for one of the best hospitals in the world to get to this step,” she wrote, “how many other people were going untreated, diagnosed with a mental illness or condemned to a life in a nursing home or a psychiatric ward?”</p>
<p>Since Dalmau’s discovery, scientists have identified more than twenty new antibodies linked to psychiatric symptoms. In 2020, in a paper in <em>The</em> <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em>, some two dozen researchers proposed a new category of illness called “autoimmune psychosis,” which may look like a milder or incomplete form of encephalitis, the illness never progressing beyond psychiatric symptoms. Christopher Bartley, the chief of a unit at the National Institute of Mental Health which investigates the role of immune dysfunction in mental illness, said that the twenty known antibodies may be a “drop in the bucket.” There could be countless targets in the brain that antibodies attack, some subset of which may alter people’s perceptions and behavior. “We have to have epistemic humility and accept that there are alternative models of disease,” Bartley said.</p>
<p>To find psychiatric patients who might benefit from immunotherapy, researchers have set up centers, roughly similar to the one at Columbia, at Baylor University Medical Center, in Texas; King’s College London; Uppsala University, in Sweden; and the University of Freiburg, in Germany, among other places. Some of the best research into the phenomenon has been conducted in Germany, where it’s more common for patients in a first episode of psychosis to have lumbar punctures to access their spinal fluid, which can reveal the presence of antibodies. Bartley estimates that between one and five per cent of people who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia actually have an autoimmune condition—a figure he based on his own lab’s research, which has not yet been published, and also on a German study of a thousand patients, the most extensive study of autoimmune psychosis so far. “Even one per cent ends up being almost a million people in the world who should be treated with a different kind of medicine,” he said.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical treatment for schizophrenia has not meaningfully changed in three-quarters of a century. Many pharmaceutical companies have left the field entirely. To get approved for the market, a medicine that works for one schizophrenic patient must have a reasonable chance of working for another. But only blunt instruments have been effective in treating an illness that takes such varied forms. Newer antipsychotics are more refined than earlier ones, with fewer side effects, but almost all of them work in the same broad way, alleviating some symptoms, like hallucinations and delusions, but not other common ones, like lack of motivation and an inability to experience pleasure. Andrew Miller, the vice-chair for research in the psychiatry department at the Emory University School of Medicine, said that the field is haunted by the early success of antipsychotics, which were discovered by serendipity, in the nineteen-fifties. “You get lulled into this sense that, because the drugs are one-size-fits-all, the disease is also one-size-fits-all,” he said. “With autoimmune psychosis, it’s so clear that there is something different. And then you start to say, ‘Hey, is it possible that there are other clear-cut mechanisms to pathology that we’re missing because we’re lumping everyone together and saying they all have the same illness?’ ”</p>

<p>The S.N.F. Center is embarking on a project, beginning this fall, to screen all the patients hospitalized in the New York State mental-health system for autoimmune, metabolic, and genetic disorders, to see if there are people whose symptoms can be traced to a distinct biological mechanism. “I’ve always been aware of the possibility that there are treatable causes for psychosis lurking in chronic long-term patients,” Joshua Gordon, the executive director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute and a former director of the N.I.M.H., told me. “But the notion that we could make this work practically—that we could test for it—has really only become apparent in the last few years.” The S.N.F. Center will do blood work for everyone in the state’s psychiatric institutions, offering follow-up testing, such as lumbar punctures, to those with unusual results. Gordon said that, if the S.N.F. Center identifies a few dozen patients who can be treated effectively enough to leave the hospital, “we will be able to start answering the question of whether this is worth trying across the whole population of people with schizophrenia.”</p>
<p>Psychiatry has a legacy of implementing drastic procedures, like lobotomies, that later come to seem like folly. But it also has a history of proffering psychological theories for illnesses that are not yet understood on a biological level. Several psychiatrists told me that they’d found themselves rereading the history of the discipline, wondering, for instance, if some of those patients of Emil Kraepelin’s whose symptoms helped define schizophrenia might actually have had encephalitis or autoimmune conditions—specifically, a subset he described as having “spasmodic phenomena in the musculature of the face” and an inability to walk without falling. There were also questions about whether these diseases could explain a condition called “lethal catatonia,” which was frequently described as a manifestation of schizophrenia: these patients became extremely agitated, and then slipped into a stupor. In 1986, in a study that inadvertently revealed the dangers of conceptual inertia, the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em> reviewed nearly three hundred cases of lethal catatonia. Nearly all the patients in the study had been treated with antipsychotics, and more than half of them died.</p>
<p>After reading Christine’s description of her mother’s case, Steven Kushner, a co-director of the S.N.F. Center, arranged a meeting with her and Mary and Angie. Mary was living at a rehabilitation center in the Bronx while she regained her muscle strength. She was reluctant to meet another psychiatrist, she told me, but she felt she needed to “rise up to the level of my daughters’ studiousness.” In October, 2024, Kushner and three colleagues came to the rehabilitation center and spoke with Mary for three hours. “Her psychosis was gone,” Kushner said. “There was no other conclusion. There was no way that she could have the quality of the conversation that we had and willfully suppress psychotic symptoms.”</p>
<p>In the conversation, Mary recounted intimate details about her daughters’ pasts—what they would eat for breakfast, their arguments at recess—but she made no reference to the delusional beliefs that had dominated their lives. When Angie told the doctors that her mother had sometimes prevented her from going outside, even to do homework with classmates, Mary offered a practical explanation: there was crime in the Bronx, and she worried about Angie’s safety. To explain why she put a sock over the showerhead in her bathroom, she said that she’d hoped to filter sediment from the water. She seemed to have filled in gaps in her memory in a way that was consistent with her current identity, as a sane person.</p>
<p>In 1911, the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler described how schizophrenic patients are capable of a kind of “double bookkeeping”: they may simultaneously live in two “disjoint” worlds, one grounded in shared reality, the other in private delusions. They might believe that they are the center of a conspiracy involving nearly everyone they see but also make small talk at a deli and remember to give the correct change. It’s as if the delusions occupy their own ontological category, sealed off from the logic used to move through the world. Now, when Mary recalls her decades of illness, it is as if she is accessing only the shared-reality side of the ledger. When she talks about her time at the Bronx Psychiatric Center, her memories sound like those of a person trapped in an environment where she doesn’t belong. “Angie and I treat it as if she had two selves,” Christine said. “But Mom describes her self as continuous.”</p>
<p>The S.N.F. Center arranged for Mary to have a lumbar puncture, to see if she had any antibodies associated with known neuropsychiatric conditions. During the procedure, Kushner said, he could sense that Mary had once had a “fantastic professional identity: she was holding court, telling stories about the lumbar punctures she used to perform, how many patients she used to see in a day.” The test came back negative. Kushner tried to recover a frozen sample of Mary’s cerebral-spinal fluid from when she was ill—a test done on that fluid would have been more revealing—but the fluid had been discarded. He believed that the most likely explanation was that she’d had a form of autoimmune psychosis for which the associated antibody has yet to be discovered. “I think the consensus is that we are probably only aware of the tip of the iceberg of different kinds of antibodies that can produce autoimmune diseases, and certainly that holds for autoimmune psychosis,” he said.</p>
<p>Some people, when they recover from psychosis, understand that the strange enemies who plagued them never actually existed. Others say that they are relieved their enemies stopped pursuing them, but do not disavow the reality of the experience. “We don’t know what happens for someone who was in a psychosis for twenty years and then they are—let’s call it ‘cured,’ ” Kushner told me. “And I hesitate to use that word, because the idea that this word is ever used in psychiatry is so exceptional.” But, he said, “the treatment modified Mary’s biology such that the disease is basically gone.”</p>
<p>Kushner began meeting with Mary and her daughters every few weeks, in part to help monitor for possible signs of relapse. At the meetings, they mostly avoided talking about Mary’s delusions. When the subject came up, Mary was quiet, or responded in a tangential way, changing the subject. “She has this extraordinarily pleasant way of disarming the situation,” Kushner told me. The thought of having caused her daughters suffering seemed too painful to allow into her conscious awareness. “There’s not an appointment that goes by where she doesn’t remark, spontaneously, that her daughters are doing well,” he said. “I don’t think that’s by accident.”</p>
<p>Kushner did not believe that Mary’s memory gaps reflected cognitive impairment—on a neuropsychological exam, her memory was better than average—but he also didn’t believe that she was purposely not remembering. “To look back and say, basically, ‘Twenty years of my life were out of reality’—that would be a fundamental blow to her identity as a physician and mom,” he said, a challenge to “one of our most primitive instincts, that we can discern what is real.” When I expressed concern about how to present the disparity in memories sensitively, he told me, “I think that is the story. How do you reconcile with, and compensate for, all those missing years?”</p>
<p>When people emerge from chronic delusional states, the work of psychiatry is considered complete. They are largely left on their own, with two irreconcilable views of reality. “We need to really start thinking about what happens the morning after these disorders are treated,” Kushner said.</p>
<p>Christine wasn’t sure if she could call her mother “cured” simply because she lacked her previous symptoms. “She’s not fixated on things like contamination and surveillance, but at no point has she said she’s left those beliefs behind,” she said. Christine felt that it was taboo to talk to her mother about who she had once been. She suffered from the intrusive thought that if she confronted her mother with destructive things she had done, Mary would somehow revert back to the patterns from that time and become psychotic again. “It is quite a traumatized-kid thing to say, but I sort of feel like, How greedy can you get? Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth,” she told me.</p>
<p>Christine didn’t know how to have an ordinary conversation with her mother. For twenty years, Mary had been suspicious when Christine asked her questions about her life. Christine now felt like an adopted child “meeting my biological mom for the first time,” she said. She bought a book by an anthropologist called “The Essential Questions: Interview Your Family to Uncover Stories and Bridge Generations” to help guide their conversations. “It says, ‘Allow them to talk about what’s important,’ ” Christine said, reading from the book, during a visit to her mother’s rehabilitation center. “If no one has ever let you speak about yourself, it can be hard,” Christine went on. “You have to kind of—”</p>
<p>“Think,” Mary said.</p>
<p>“Maybe practice—gain your voice,” Christine said.</p>
<p>Christine, who recorded the conversation, began with warmup questions: “When you were a kid, what was your favorite activity?”</p>
<p>“Running,” Mary answered immediately.</p>
<p>“What did you like about running?”</p>
<p>“It makes you feel you have wings.”</p>
<p>“What is your favorite TV show?” Christine asked.</p>
<p>“ ‘Seinfeld.’ ”</p>
<p>“ ‘Seinfeld’!” Christine said. “What did you like about ‘Seinfeld’?”</p>
<p>“The absurdity.”</p>
<p>Every few weeks, they tackled a new theme outlined in the book: time, identity, body, belief, possessions, memory, fear. Initially, Mary answered in few words, but eventually she became much more expansive. During one session, she offered that her views on physical discipline had evolved: she no longer thought that smacking was acceptable. Christine said, “Without relating it to me or Angie, she sort of said, ‘That’s what we were taught when we were younger, but I don’t think that’s the right way to raise a kid.’ ” Christine felt that her mother may have been reflecting, obliquely, on what had happened in their home. “The ability to say, ‘I’ve changed my mind’ felt like as much as I could ask for,” Christine said.</p>
<p>For years, Christine had been documenting her life—keeping a journal, saving records, recording important conversations—to compensate for the fact that she, too, had blank periods in her memories, coinciding with traumatic events. She wasn’t sure if her mother’s breaks in memory—what she and Angie called “the missing years”—were different from her own. Recently, she had come across a proverb: “The axe forgets, but the tree remembers.” She felt that maybe she and her mother had reached an impasse that was actually universal—children have always formed their identities around blows that their parents don’t even realize they inflicted.</p>
<p>Angie felt less accommodating: “I’m happy that my mom is normal now, that we can have a deep connection and I can share my life with her. And, at the same time, I want justice for the child who was hurt by that other mother.”</p>
<p>Mary’s sister, Nima, told me that before her illness Mary was “very enduring, very patient.” Mary’s recommendations from professors at medical school describe her as “kind and sympathetic,” always “willing to shoulder any extra work.” When she came out of her psychosis, Mary returned to this dutiful version of herself. She and her husband, Chris, began speaking on the phone every day. Chris told me that he felt as if he were re-meeting the woman he had known in the early years of their marriage. “How come I lived all these years of darkness, and she suddenly looks normal to me?” he said. “She gives me comfort. She gives me emotional support.”</p>
<p>He asked her to do things, like travel to India to resolve a family financial dispute, that Christine and Angie found inappropriate. They encouraged Mary not to comply with the request. Mary had let go of her paranoia that everyone was targeting her, but they wished she could retain a wariness about people who had hurt her in the past. “Now that she’s better, you can see how the delusions protected her from people stepping on her boundaries—and she doesn’t have a replacement strategy,” Christine said.</p>
<p>Mary readily agreed to speak with me for this story, but she struggled to imagine that she could be anything more than a marginal presence in it. For years, she had described how people on TV were lifting ideas and plots from her life story. “It was like she was saying, ‘I’m important,’ ” Christine said. “ ‘I have value. I have things to say.’ And now we’re saying, ‘You’re important. You have value. You have things to say.’ And she can’t access that sense of deserving to be the main character.”</p>
<p>When I first met Mary, on a Zoom call with her and Christine and Angie, I asked if I could read her psychiatric records. She said yes but warned that they would be very boring, adding that she couldn’t remember any of her psychiatrists. “I left the memories long before I left the place,” she said. Christine suggested that we interpret this as her mother’s gentle way of saying no.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Christine told me, Mary found a pile of psychiatric records in her room: “She was, like, ‘I don’t want to see them anymore, so Rachel can have them and can get rid of them.’ And I was, like, ‘Yes, Mom, but Rachel is a journalist. She’s not just a professional shredder.’ ” She said that her mom responded, “I just don’t want to see them myself.”</p>
<p>Mary seemed to be working out her ambivalence about her memories through this pile of papers. After speaking on Zoom every week for two months, Mary and I met at her rehabilitation center, along with Christine and Angie. Toward the end of our conversation, she stood up without explanation, walked to a cabinet, retrieved the psychiatric records, and gave them to me. “I felt like what happened was a miracle,” she told me. “If it will give anyone else confidence, I’ll go with it.”</p>
<p>There is almost no medical literature about the afterlife of madness, the experience of letting go of what Jaspers called the “definite idea.” Autoimmune psychosis raises the possibility of a swift, full recovery—a trajectory not typically seen in schizophrenia—and in doing so supplies a new category of witness: a person who can describe what it feels like to look back on a self that is, in some sense, defunct. And yet sanity does not mean that a person views the past without defensiveness or distortion. (To see too clearly can lead to a different kind of insanity, depression.) One of Christine’s fears was that, in talking with her mother about what she and Angie had been through, she would “rob her of the human capacity for denial.”</p>
<p>During one of my visits to the rehabilitation center, I asked Mary if she’d like to know how I was writing about her daughters’ memories of her illness, or if she’d prefer not to listen to that part of the story. Christine and I sat in chairs, and Mary sat on the edge of her bed, beside a wooden table on wheels that she used both for eating and as a desk. Mary quickly responded that she wanted to know what her children recalled. “I’ll go with that, because that way it will help me to remember,” she said.</p>
<p>“You remember things very differently, and it might be painful,” Christine said, gently. “Do you feel comfortable emotionally with that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, go ahead!” Mary said. “I’ll remember like a mother. I won’t remember from your point of view.” She told her, “This is the best time for me to relate to these memories and make amends.”</p>
<p>Christine shared her first memory of the illness: sitting on the couch as her mother told her that the professor from medical school was in love with her.</p>
<p>Mary sat straight up on the bed, holding her arms over her stomach, staring intently at Christine. She had the bearing of a diligent student determined to pass a difficult test.</p>
<p>“You asked if they had ever put things in my hair so that”—</p>
<p>“Microphones,” Mary said quickly. “Microphones.” She said that the professor and his friends kept urging her to leave her husband: “They said, ‘Don’t worry about the in-laws and all—just move away and begin on your own.’ ” The friends were trying to help, but they were also harassing her, and she had no one to confide in. “I felt like she was supposed to be there for me,” Mary said, gesturing toward Christine. “But she was talking on behalf of my friends.”</p>
<p>“You would think that I was repeating phrases that were said to me by other people.”</p>
<p>“I remember that very well,” Mary said.</p>
<p>“As a kid, I found it very hurtful.”</p>
<p>“I never blamed you,” Mary said. “But my classmates—I trusted them so much.”</p>
<p>“I was not in contact with your classmates,” Christine said, in a measured tone. “I would explain that to you, but it felt like you didn’t believe me at that time.” She asked, “Now that I’m older, do you trust me when I say they weren’t talking to me?”</p>
<p>Mary said it was possible that Christine had been reading her e-mails, rather than talking directly to the classmates, or that Christine’s father was the one telling Christine what to say. “She was very articulate,” Mary said. “She would do everything he would tell her.”</p>
<p>Mary explained that the feeling of being harassed—sometimes by people from her past, sometimes by strangers—continued until several weeks after her cancer diagnosis. “I felt like they were working through the doctors, and I had to take the chemotherapy just to hurt me and make me bald and make me lose weight and humiliate me,” she said.</p>
<p>But then, a few weeks into her treatment, her dreams became uncharacteristically pleasant. She kept dreaming of her sister and brothers, and they were so sensitive and loving that she thought maybe this was the prelude to a kind of heavenly afterlife. In time, the dreams began to feel more conscious, as if she were guiding the scenes herself. Lying in her hospital bed, she tried to recall details about her childhood home which she hadn’t thought about in years. “Whatever I could catch on to, I would collect,” she said.</p>
<p>Her reëmergence seemed to have occurred weeks before her daughters grasped what was happening. Her muscles were so weak that she couldn’t say more than a word at a time, and she wished she could communicate to her daughters, “I’m smiling. I’m all right with this.”</p>
<p>The thought that people were secretly trying to punish her hadn’t completely disappeared, but it felt distant, a relic of a different era. When the thought resurfaced, she said, “I take myself out of it, and I say, ‘It’s not my burden.’ I put the whole thing, like a gift basket, to God.” She’d been taught this coping mechanism as a schoolgirl, but until recently it hadn’t worked.</p>
<p>Christine felt both validated and disoriented by the idea that, between her and her mother, the facts were never really in question. “It is painful to hear that she still thinks I was spying on her all those years, but now she says, ‘I am so proud of my daughters—they take care of me,’ ” she said. “Maybe her interpretation is that through the power of forgiveness she can now interact with me as her loving daughter. So can I make do with that?”</p>
<p>For a year, Christine and Angie had been speaking on Zoom with a family therapist, to help process the changes in their mother. Recently, Mary had begun participating in the conversations, too. During a session, Christine suggested that the three of them begin a process of sharing grievances, each taking a turn. “There were different times when each of us was a flawed caretaker,” Christine said. She knew that her mother must have felt betrayed when she called the mobile crisis unit. Mary agreed: “I felt very let down because nobody trusted me enough to share that information.” Christine began by telling her, “I did my best, and yet I’m sorry I hurt you.”</p>
<p>Although Christine and Angie felt they had already worked out the conflicts in their own relationship, they tried “performing a kind of play,” as Christine put it: they shared resentments—Angie’s feelings of abandonment, Christine’s sense that Angie didn’t want her help—and then apologized, “so that at some point she can say the words to us.” Each emphasized that she didn’t think the other was a bad person, and that it was O.K. that they remembered things differently. They tried any exonerating phrase they could think of, “in case these might be the mental blocks for her,” Christine said.</p>
<p>Mary was enthusiastic about the process, but Christine sensed that she didn’t quite know what to say when it was her turn. A lifelong student of her mother’s mind, Christine had several justifications for her mother’s failure to respond in kind: she had not grown up in a culture where regrets were aired in this way; the inability to see her daughters’ perspective was a lingering cognitive symptom; in her fragile state, apologizing required a level of confidence she didn’t yet have. “At this stage of my life, I need to feel like my mother is back,” Christine told me. Later on, maybe in a few years, she said, “I’ll deal with the fact that it was an imperfect mother who was returned to me.” ♦</p>

<p>By Pankaj Mishra</p>
<hr>
<p>“It may be,” Edmund Wilson wrote in 1929, “that the United States will develop into a great imperialistic power with all its artists, critics, and philosophers as ineffective and as easily extinguished as the German ones were in 1914.” Wilson, born in 1895, came of age when national energies were still turned inward, and a largely Europhilic American intelligentsia possessed little cultural capital or self-confidence. He lived long enough to deplore his country’s midcentury turn from doctrinaire isolationism to righteous superpowerdom. “Whenever we engage in a war or move in on some other country,” he wrote in <em>Patriotic Gore</em> (1962), “it is always to liberate somebody.”</p>
<p>Wilson came to dislike the “all too conscious American literary self-glorification which is a part of our American imperialism.” He caustically noted the behavior of onetime radicals rushing to embrace personal opportunities for wealth and status in their freshly affluent society. John Dos Passos, writing on Barry Goldwater, sounded like a “teenager squealing over the Beatles.” He identified John F. Kennedy as an intellectual poseur, defying a burgeoning cult of American writers who viewed the U.S. president as a serious reader and thinker. During the Vietnam War, Wilson refused an invitation from Lyndon Johnson with, as the president’s special consultant recorded, “a brusqueness” never before known at the White House.</p>
<p>It is not hard to imagine what America’s preeminent critic would have made of the writers exulting over their inclusion in Barack Obama’s reading lists (issued occasionally while Obama worked, on Tuesdays, on “kill lists” targeting young men in South Asia and the Middle East). It’s easier to guess what Wilson would have thought of Marilynne Robinson declaring, as late as 2024, that Joe Biden was a “gift of God, all eighty-one years of him,” or of Timothy Snyder delivering, that same year, a “Biden benediction.”</p>
<p>Wilson’s vision of the brittleness of the American intelligentsia before a brazenly imperialist regime has never been more fully realized. While threatening the annexation of lands on multiple continents and absentmindedly supervising genocide in Palestine, Donald Trump is actively attempting to hollow out, with scarcely any effective opposition from their custodians, all major academic and cultural establishments in the United States. Many Americans are demonstrably disgusted, shamed, and angered by their tyrants, but mainstream literary and intellectual institutions seem unable or unwilling to give voice to them. As its icons flee to Canada and Europe, “resistance liberalism” is being outsourced to Harvard University, where its pusillanimity is further revealed through a president carefully implementing Trumpian strictures against “campus culture.”</p>
<p>This swift and near-total capitulation to political depravity is for many people outside the United States an extraordinary sight. The American intelligentsia has presented itself since 1945 as the worldwide guarantor of intellectual and creative freedom. From the beginning of the Cold War, its cultural institutions, whether the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a number of prominent creative writing programs, or PEN America itself, have promoted the idea of a literary sphere that is credible and respectable only when it is independent from political parties, state-controlled institutions, and propagandistic media.</p>
<p>Of course, it was always possible to argue, as Viet Thanh Nguyen did recently while complaining about “writers who say nothing,” that American literary institutions are not autonomous but “a part of empire, supported by the state or by powerful donors who benefit from the imperial machinery.” Indeed, Cold War–era American institutions and personalities who promoted the ideal of aesthetic autonomy while trying to dissuade writers and artists from left-wing politics and propagandizing (sometimes with the help of CIA subventions) represented a glaring contradiction. Their own failure to stand up to Senator Joseph McCarthy’s demagoguery hardly recommended their version of artistic iconoclasm and political neutrality.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, outsiders marveled at the pronounced American sense of moral and cultural primacy, which seemed to be guaranteed by hard power and enforced synergistically by the State Department, PEN America, the <em>New York Times,</em> Human Rights Watch, and Ivy League universities. The experience of fascism and despotism in Europe and Latin America, and racist imperialism in Asia and Africa, had forced nearly every writer and intellectual of stature around the world, from Albert Camus and Julio Cortázar to Naguib Mahfouz and Nadine Gordimer, into moral commitment, which became more explicit and articulate during crises. None of these ineluctably engagé authors, however, could count on, in their own nations, the same sprawling material infrastructure for literature and ideology that had been forged by the United States during its crusade against Soviet Communism.</p>
<p>As it happened, many victims of tyrannical regimes and fanatical movements ended up seeking refuge in the United States. These exiles and expatriates, from Hannah Arendt to Thomas Mann, Czesław Miłosz to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, helped define the intolerable pressures on the individual conscience in our time, and stressed the importance of saying “no” to violence and falsehood.</p>
<p>Their robust negations appeared to put both them and their American hosts on the right side of history, compared with writers in the unfree world of authoritarian regimes, who seemed to have been permanently tainted by lies, equivocations, and evasions. It was from the elevated ground of the open society that Martin Amis, briefly a proponent of collective punishment for Muslims, exhorted Westerners in 2007 to feel morally superior to the Taliban, and Salman Rushdie, champion of a “war of liberation” in Iraq, condemned, in 2012, that year’s laureate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Mo Yan, as a “patsy” of the Chinese regime. More recently, cultural organizations and academic institutions reenacted the old Cold War skit casting the eastern seaboard as the vanguard of human emancipation as they denounced Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine and extended support to Ukrainian writers and academics.</p>
<p>For all its claims to superior virtue, the liberal American intelligentsia manifests very little of the courage and dignity it has expected from artists and thinkers in less fortunate societies, as hooded and masked officials disappear students for the crime of writing school-newspaper op-eds and liking social-media posts. Dissenters from far-right orthodoxies in the United States did not face such a concerted onslaught even in the early Fifties, when, threatened by the House Un-American Activities Committee, pursued by the FBI, and canceled by the Library of Congress, Thomas Mann departed the arsenal of democracy for Switzerland. Today, the “disgusting exhibition,” as Mann saw the witch hunts of McCarthyism, “of primitive Puritanism, hatred, fear, corruption and self-righteousness” is much more extensive. The destruction of U.S. institutions in order to suppress criticism of Israeli war crimes speaks to a pathology of self-mutilation that is striking even when measured against Stalin’s and Mao’s regimes (which, though infinitely more brutal, cared, above all, about projecting an image of national autonomy and sovereignty).</p>
<p>But the American intelligentsia is very far from manifesting a movement of moral and political self-criticism comparable to that of the intrepid dissidents it celebrated during the Cold War. No second “<em>Harper’s</em> Letter” has emerged, locating the threats to free expression in an extremist ruling class, narcissistic Silicon Valley oligarchs, free-speech hucksters, and cravenly self-censoring media organizations and think tanks. The writers crying “<em>Je suis</em> Charlie” in 2015 have not made themselves heard saying “<em>Je suis</em> Refaat Alareer.” Nor has an institutionally backed solidarity rally of the kind that occurred after the attempted assassination of Rushdie been witnessed at the New York Public Library over the targeted killings of writers and journalists in Palestine. (Rushdie himself has accused student protesters of anti-Semitism and of supporting a “fascist terrorist group.”)</p>
<p>More than seven hundred writers signed a letter endorsing Kamala Harris. No one among them attempted, against the genocidal foreign policy of a senile president and his loyal deputies, the type of mild but prominent dissent voiced by Robert Lowell in an open letter to Lyndon Johnson that the <em>New York Times</em> published on its front page on June 3, 1965: “I . . . can only follow our present foreign policy with the greatest dismay and distrust.” Resistance liberalism yet again demonstrated its limits when Anne Applebaum, one of the most voluble heralds of global “autocracy,” took a strict vow of silence over the American-Israeli campaign of extermination—perhaps because she had once argued, in an article titled “Kill the Messenger,” that assassination was a legitimate strategy against Palestinian journalists.</p>
<p>It is possible that many writers believe, as John Updike did during the napalming of Vietnam, that they “had voted,” thus earning their “American right not to make a political decision for another four years.” Like Updike, they may think that their “stock in trade as an American author” includes an identification with the United States’ “national fortunes,” and that, as “privileged members of a privileged nation [they] believed that their pleasant position could be maintained without anything visibly ugly happening in the world.”</p>
<p>In any case, only a few writers, strikingly almost all of non-Western ancestry, have taken the risk of pointing out truths distorted or concealed by interlocking class and ideological interests. As Kaveh Akbar put it recently: “It is excruciating to be the Muslim in every room forcing people to think about genocide, but I do not have the luxury of shitty cynicism or breezy despair.” It is also excruciatingly awkward for me, a nonresident alien (in IRS parlance), to say this: that the liberal American intelligentsia seems to have relaxed too cozily into imperial cultures of exaggerated self-esteem and self-satisfaction. A professionalized, even bureaucratized, and politically neutered literary-intellectual elite long ago shredded whatever countercultural aura the vocation had acquired over centuries; its compromised and enfeebled state is more vividly revealed today by the demons of sadism and stupidity rampaging across the United States.</p>
<p>Until 1945 at least, American writers resembled their counterparts elsewhere around the globe: mostly uncertain about their nation’s role in the world and troubled, if not personally damaged, by the age of extremes. The endless economic crises, wrenching social and political conflicts, and far-right insurrections of the low, dishonest decade made it impossible for many writers to remain neutral observers of social and ideological struggles. The pressures of conscience and craving for drama took Dos Passos and Hemingway to the Spanish Civil War. Edmund Wilson reported from picket lines during the Great Depression, traveled to the Soviet Union, and authored an introduction to revolutionary thought.</p>
<p>After 1945, an isolationist country found itself the world’s preeminent power, made stronger and more prosperous by a war that had reduced much of Europe and Asia to ruins. Visiting the United States in 1960, Italo Calvino noted the growing “abyss” between America and the rest of the world that made the country seem as alien as the moon. Calvino was struck by the relatively luxurious circumstances of American writers, and wondered whether the price for such plenitude was a “death of the soul.” Others worried, especially after the quick intellectual surrender to McCarthy in the early Fifties, about more tangible threats to the life of the mind in a simultaneously rich and conformist civilization. The intellect in America, Irving Howe warned in his classic 1954 essay “This Age of Conformity,” was increasingly prone to “some undignified prostrations” before wealth and power.</p>
<p>External observers have long been struck by the rampant depoliticization that has made the most celebrated American writers susceptible to the lures of unprincipled power and vacuous celebrity: for instance, David Foster Wallace spending over twenty thousand words to investigate, indecisively, whether John McCain was a moral hero and a “real leader or merely a very talented political salesman,” when a quick glance at the voting record of the warmongering Republican senator would have sufficed. In recent years, writers abroad who are, or romantically see themselves as, necessarily alienated critics of society have been baffled to see American counterparts gratefully receiving laurels from Barack Obama, “our own Black shining prince,” as Ta-Nehisi Coates, borrowing from Ossie Davis’s eulogy of Malcolm X, put it. In their eyes, some unprecedented confusion of literature with neoliberal chic occurred when Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie read aloud, at the PEN America World Voices Festival, her <em>Atlantic</em> article that she had wanted to title “Why Is Hillary Clinton So Widely Loved?” as the former secretary of state looked on fondly.</p>
<p>These spectacles of writers speaking reassurance to power confirm Christopher Lasch’s diagnosis of more than half a century ago: that American “intellectuals, as a class, had achieved official recognition, affluence, prestige, and power, and something of the mentality that goes with them”: they had developed a stake in the perpetuation of the Pax Americana. Robert Frost matched the most spineless Stalinist hack by hailing the advent of “a golden age of poetry and power” when Kennedy arrived at the White House. In a new poem written for the inauguration, Robert Frost proposed an unprecedented alliance between imperial and literary authorities:</p>
<p>We see how seriously the races swarm<br>In their attempts at sovereignty and form.<br>They are our wards we think to some extent<br>For the time being and with their consent,<br>To teach them how Democracy is meant.</p>
<p>The central working assumption of PEN America and of the State Department—that the liberal American can teach the seriously swarming races what is meant by democracy—has been annihilated. Even some commonly used concepts that once seemed self-evident—American democracy, globalization, the West, and the rules-based international order—lie shattered. And it won’t be possible anymore for the liberal American intelligentsia to run up massive intellectual and moral deficits with American power as the invisible reserve currency.</p>
<p>Its helplessness today puts into sharper contrast its will to power, its often peremptory redefining of what art, literature, politics, democracy, and human rights are or are not. Shorn of its revolving door to the State Department and the Democratic Party establishment, PEN America will henceforth eke out a miserable existence, trying to simulate moral and intellectual supremacy long after its demise. Other enforcers of America’s postwar cultural hegemony are also likely to find themselves diminished. And, perhaps, a brutal estrangement from sources of power and patronage would be salutary in the long term.</p>
<p>It will be hard, though not impossible, for the beneficiaries of the remarkable American bonanza of grants, fellowships, and awards to break out of their elitist self-isolation and turn into dissidents. At the same time, adaptation to a regime of insolent cruelty and mendacity would require an amount of shitty cynicism that is fatal to intellectual and imaginative work. Too many consciences will be torn and shaken. American intellectual and literary culture may or may not abandon its deference to power and wealth and go to that necessary war against itself in order to salvage its dignity and purpose. But there is some cause for hope in the certainty that the best and brightest in the American intelligentsia won’t go looking for crumbs from the presidential table. Spurning breezy despair and jovial resignation, they might even assume the usual condition of writers elsewhere: a bitter but spiritually liberating powerlessness.</p>

<h1 id="your-face-tomorrow"><strong>Your Face Tomorrow</strong></h1>
<p>By Michael W. Clune</p>
<hr>
<p>I first realized there was a new use for my face when I got my passport renewed in November 2023. I went to the local CVS to have my photo taken. The harried woman behind the counter groaned and led me to the corner of the store where they took the pictures.</p>
<p>She told me to stand in front of a white screen. It was the only usable surface of the store that was not covered by words about consumer medical products, images of consumer medical products, or the bright colors associated with consumer medical products. The screen was the blank white of a medical crisis.</p>
<p>She told me to take off my glasses. I did. It was blurry, but I could just make out the electronic camera’s tiny lens embedded in the black device before me.</p>
<p>I waited.</p>
<p>“Stop that,” she said.</p>
<p>“Stop what?”</p>
<p>“The . . . that thing you’re doing with your face.”</p>
<p>“My face?”</p>
<p>“Smiling,” she said irritably. “Stop smiling. You’re not supposed to smile.”</p>
<p>You’re not supposed to smile? I hadn’t remembered that being the rule the last time I got my passport renewed. Had something changed?</p>
<p>I relaxed the muscles of my face. It felt strange to be standing there in the middle of the store with no expression at all. What they want with my face has nothing to do with my expression, I thought. This isn’t about what I can do with my face. This is about what <em>they</em> can do with it.</p>
<p>A word from something I’d read recently swam into my consciousness. <em>Faceprint:</em> “A digital scan or photograph of a human face, used for identifying individuals from the unique characteristics of facial structure.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said.</p>
<p>When I put my glasses back on, I looked into the reflective glass of the camera. It looked like the black, expressionless eye of an insect. What does an ant see when it looks at your face? I didn’t know. I thought about ants because a bug’s perspective seemed like the most alien thing I could imagine.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand then that the machine behind the eye of that camera is much more alien than an ant. Scientists know a lot of things about insect optical processing. But no one knows what artificial intelligence sees when it looks at a picture of your face.</p>
<p>The large language models that programmers train to identify faces are black boxes. Even the engineers don’t know how or in what form your face appears to the system. All they know is that AI likes your face to be brightly lit. And that it prefers for you not to smile.</p>
<p>This initial brush with an alien way of seeing my face made me attend a little more consciously to the normal, human way of using my face. A couple weeks later, I went to my department’s annual holiday party, at the home of the chair. As my wife and I approached the front door, my face began to change.</p>
<p>Up until that moment, driving over to the chair’s house, I hadn’t been paying much attention to it. Lauren would say something funny and I’d laugh. I squinted a little when we turned off the brightly lit road.</p>
<p>My face was like a pool of water—someone would toss in a pebble and ripples would spread. Or it would hold the faint impression of a blown leaf, floating on the surface. Natural impressions, organic expressions.</p>
<p>But standing there, waiting for the department chair’s door to open, I put a very specific smile on my face. I did it manually, so to speak. I had a pretty good idea of what it looked like, from mirrors and photographs of myself. Happy. Open. Excited—not too excited. Definitely not too excited.</p>
<p>I briefly wished that all department chairs’ houses had cameras set in their walls, so I could compare my current smile-at-the-holiday-party-door with the smile I had put on when I was an associate professor, and before that an assistant professor, and before that a graduate student. I speculated that a skilled anthropologist could derive my precise status in the department from the nature of my smile. The “smileprints,” placed next to one another, would describe an arc—from the smile of someone who wanted to please to the smile of someone with a gracious willingness to be pleased.</p>
<p>As I moved through the party, my facial expressions modulated. Polite interest as someone described the repairs being done to their home. Quiet smile of acknowledgment at a perfunctory joke. Deferential and concerned attentiveness to an elderly retired faculty member’s description of a medical procedure. Furrowed brow of performed thought after someone asked my opinion of a recent essay.</p>
<p>And then, just once, just as my face began to tire from this incessant demand to express, I emitted an aggressive, open shout of laughter at my own joke, followed by a gleaming, tigerish grin around the little circle of colleagues whose own faces described an arc of smiles ranging from defensive to liberated.</p>
<p>Liberated? Liberated from the pressure—the constant pressure that accumulates on one’s face in social situations, a pressure felt in one’s facial muscles. There are approximately forty-three of them: some ten thousand possible configurations. Each configuration has a meaning, each one is judged and evaluated and acclaimed or condemned or let pass by the ten thousand possible configurations of the face of the person watching you, who is also being watched by you, and by others, one of whom may be artificial.</p>
<p>I knew it was time to leave the party when my face had frozen into a rictus grin. This condition exposed me. It’s a symptom of terminal facial overload, a sign that my forty-three muscles were fighting against relaxation.</p>
<p>The people to whom I was listening could tell that my face was trembling on the verge of a total absence of expression. I could sense this not in their mouths, but in the muscles around their eyes. Such a face would be like a giant unhewn boulder dropped into the middle of the chair’s tastefully decorated living room. People will do just about anything to avoid witnessing such a face in a human social situation.</p>
<p>This is the face AI likes best. Sometimes I think I might prefer it, too.</p>
<p>Like many other forms of AI, facial-recognition software received a shot in the arm from the maturation of artificial neural networks such as the large language models powering systems like ChatGPT. The process used by most current methods contains several steps. First, the software translates a photo or video of your face into a set of measurements—the distance between your eyes, between your nose and your lips, and so on. Then this “faceprint” is fed into an artificial neural network. This system uses statistical methods to match your faceprint to others in its database. Programmers “train” the system by rewarding it for correct matches and penalizing it for misses. The model generates results in the same way that LLMs produce language—by processing a large database in order to obtain statistical relationships among entities. Eventually, and with a sufficiently large database, the system can reliably match one image of a face with another. Given adequate lighting and a relatively clear picture, software can match your passport photo with your appearance in a party photo on a friend’s Facebook page, for example, 99 percent of the time.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly how the system obtains its matches. There is an entire field in AI known as “mechanistic interpretability” that is attempting to understand how LLMs move from a given input (your passport photo) to a given output (identifying your face in the Facebook post). The existence of this field—and its limited success thus far, despite the significant resources devoted to it—is one index of the alien quality of the “thinking” that goes on in artificial “minds.”</p>
<p>The opacity of these systems has created controversy, with various advocacy groups arguing that citizens possess a “right to explanation” in cases wherein a black-box process leads to an adverse outcome. If a bank denies your loan application using an algorithm, or if you discover at the airport that you’ve been placed on a terrorist watch list by an AI system, you should be able to find out why. The European Union, as part of the General Data Protection Regulation of 2016, provides such a right to explanation, though no similar legislation exists yet in the United States.</p>
<p>Even with rapid improvements in the technology, the danger of being wrongly identified as a criminal remains. A 2024 <em>New York Times</em> story identified three individuals who had been subject to such mistaken identification by the Detroit Police Department, which has used facial-recognition technology since 2017. Various factors contribute to mistakes of this kind. For example, while there’s been progress in obtaining correct matches with blurry or shadowed or smiling faces, systems can still struggle with such images; thus, perhaps, the CVS worker’s demand that I not smile. But the primary constraint on effectiveness is the size of the database. You need tens of thousands, and preferably millions, of images of faces to train the system to optimal precision.</p>
<p>If occasional inaccuracy is one reason to worry about AI-powered facial recognition, the larger concern is its effectiveness. Decades of unease over the rise of electronic surveillance have primed us to freak out. The nonspecialist writing on the subject operates in a genre one might call paranoid realism; the recent bestseller <em>Your Face Belongs to Us,</em> by the journalist Kashmir Hill*,* for example, tells the story of the company Clearview AI and dwells exhaustively on the dystopian implications of the technology.</p>
<p>Its possible use cases are certainly freak-out-worthy. Consider: A stalker with access to the software could take a picture of you and then find out where you live, where you work, who your friends are, and where you get your groceries. Surveillance cameras mounted in public streets could record you walking into a strip club or a pot dispensary, and on this basis, a credit agency or employer could deny you a job or a loan. And the government might deploy the technology to discover everything anyone has ever done, and punish them for it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hill describes the enthusiasm for the technology among law-enforcement agencies, which point to its efficacy in helping them track down wanted criminals. Cops can use facial recognition to identify child pornographers and abusers from images circulating on the dark web. They believe, plausibly, that the use of these systems could prevent terrorist attacks. But in the context of Hill’s well-researched book, the theoretical positive uses seem overwhelmed by a swirl of anecdotes, speculations, and predictions that suggest this technology is on the verge of plunging us into a more efficient version of Orwell’s Oceania. Certainly that was my experience reading the book.</p>
<p>When I try to examine the threat of facial-recognition software dispassionately, I see the problem boiling down to two basic questions. The first is: Do we trust the government agencies that have access to such systems? If we do, then the benefits of preventing terrorism or child abuse might well outweigh the potential abuses and inaccuracies. If we don’t, then it seems our first task should be to bring these agencies under democratic accountability. After all, if the government is out to get us, it has enough tools to do so even without AI.</p>
<p>The second question is: How much do we value our privacy? There’s been renewed discussion in recent years of the putative “right to privacy” that, in a celebrated 1890 article, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis argued was derivable from existing U.S. law. But if it exists—and this remains debatable—such a right comes, even in its original formulation, with a host of exceptions. A right to privacy can in many cases come into conflict with the better-established First Amendment right to free expression. Most of the photos held in vast corporate databases (think of your Facebook photos) or government databases (think of your passport photo) were gathered with the explicit or implicit permission of the subjects. Experts have long been familiar with the “privacy paradox,” whereby we say we value our privacy while uploading our photos to public forums, opting into requests to monitor and share our online behavior, and so forth.</p>
<p>In short, when I think carefully about the threat posed by facial recognition, my instinctive, paranoid response gives way to more ambiguous reflections. Maybe—like everything else—this thing will be good in some contexts and for some uses, and bad in some others. Perhaps this isn’t a black-and-white case, but one that involves trade-offs between different values, like privacy and safety.</p>
<p>And now I begin to wonder about that paranoid response, the feeling of horror that first came over me when reading Hill’s book, and subsequently as I searched the web for similar stories about facial recognition. What is the source of this paranoia? Perhaps, I began to suspect, my instinctive urge to reject and ban this software is something like a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>A defense against what? When we consider the way AI makes use of faces, we inevitably contrast it with the way humans make use of faces. The flip side of the paranoid revulsion at AI is an idealized, even romantic sense of the comforting familiarity of human face-to-face interactions. As with so many situations in which we confront new technology, our tendency is to project our fears onto the new thing and to cling to the old, natural way.</p>
<p>But sometimes the old, natural way is the problem. Professors like myself hate ChatGPT and similar platforms because our students turn in artificially generated, robotic papers. But if we ordinarily gave vapid, shallow papers the D’s or F’s they deserved, this problem wouldn’t exist. The fact that such papers routinely get A’s or B’s shows that we have come to expect and to train <em>humans</em> to write robotic papers. Similarly, when I worry I can’t distinguish a colleague’s genuine sentiments from the vaporous generalities Gmail’s AI suggests, what am I really worrying about? Is it that the machine is so good? Or that my interactions with my colleague are so empty?</p>
<p>Once we step back from the paranoid reaction, the problem presented by AI facial recognition assumes different contours. In posing anew the question of <em>facial control,</em> the technology provides us with an opportunity to think about how such control works in both its artificial <em>and</em> natural forms.</p>
<p>If we’re serious about privacy, we should examine the problem seriously—not neglecting the ordinary, traditional, everyday, nontechnical cases in which our privacy is at stake. In her book, Hill expresses one of my favorite arguments in favor of privacy when she writes, “Anonymity provides powerful protection for those who don’t conform to the status quo.” I am among those who believe that conformity is the enemy of the creative, social, and conceptual breakthroughs that enrich and transform human life. When my face is known, I shed the protective invisibility of anonymity. The protean, multiform energies within me become measurable, locatable, predictable, controllable. My face is the hole through which the status quo enters me, disciplines me. It has always been this way.</p>
<p>But now I have two faces. Two doors that swing open to two different forms of control. The first door is my face on my passport. The second door is my face at the department holiday party.</p>
<p>Let’s look a little closer at what’s behind door number one.</p>
<p>In early November 2024, I visited Yu Yin’s lab at Case Western Reserve University, where I taught at the time. In a modern research university, people rarely have a clear idea of what their colleagues in other departments are doing. I learned of Yin’s work on facial recognition during a reception for the board of trustees, where I found myself speaking with the head of her department. This intelligent, engaging man worked on a different branch of AI. Over the course of our conversation, I came to think of him as a character in an eighteenth-century novel, the Optimist. He all but suggested this name himself.</p>
<p>“I am an entrepreneur,” he told me at once. “I have to be an optimist.”</p>
<p>Upon learning that I was thinking of writing an article about AI, he expressed unalloyed enthusiasm for the revolution. I decided to test his optimism.</p>
<p>“Some people,” I said tentatively, “think that facial recognition poses a threat to privacy.”</p>
<p>He waved his hand dismissively.</p>
<p>“No one really cares about privacy,” he said, citing research on the privacy paradox.</p>
<p>I decided to try something a little bolder, remembering a theme of the AI conference in New York where I’d been invited to give a keynote lecture that October.</p>
<p>“Some people,” I suggested, “think that the development of AI will soon hit a wall. There was a recent study in <em>Nature</em> showing once LLMs begin to be trained on AI-generated text, they start spewing nonsense.”</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>“These problems are fixable. Do you understand the speed of progress in AI research? Let me give you an example. On Monday, my graduate students and I post a paper online about a problem. Thousands of people all over the world read it. They work on the problem. On Thursday they publish a new paper citing our paper.”</p>
<p>By this point, an elderly trustee had joined us.</p>
<p>“Everything is getting better all the time,” said the Optimist.</p>
<p>The trustee nodded in approval at these confident pronouncements. I wondered if my interlocutor’s optimism had any limit.</p>
<p>At the end of our little exchange, he told me of Yin’s work on facial recognition and suggested I contact her. Thus it was that I found myself in her lab in the School of Engineering on a cold, clear November morning. She’d promised she would make a faceprint of me and that I would be able to see the whole process. This excited me, because getting direct experience of the technology had proved rather difficult. I began my visit by mentioning this.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she agreed. “This software is not available for consumers. My personal view is that applications that identify a person’s face should not be licensed for consumer use.”</p>
<p>“Because of the danger of stalkers using it, that kind of thing?”</p>
<p>She nodded. She told me she had been born in China and had lived there through her undergraduate years, moving to the United States for graduate training.</p>
<p>Part of the work being done in her lab, she explained, involved taking photographs of individuals and then animating them. With a recording of the individual’s voice, one could use AI vocal programs to make their face say various things, complete with the requisite expressions and mouth movements.</p>
<p>One possible application might be for something like Zoom calls, where you could deploy an avatar of yourself, and speak into the microphone with your AI avatar speaking your words perfectly, your face looking absolutely natural, no one the wiser. They weren’t yet able to get the animation to work in real time, but they were making progress.</p>
<p>I envisioned someone getting a picture of my face, and then using the tech to make a Zoom call to my elderly mother, asking her for money. Yin smiled, and acknowledged that this technology might be abused. But it could also have benefits—for gaming or film, for example.</p>
<p>At this point, one of her graduate students arrived, and Yin informed me that it was time for my faceprint. Suddenly I became a little nervous. Somehow I had imagined a vaguely medical scenario. I would be led, I imagined, from this small white-paneled room, full of more or less recognizable computing equipment, into a different space. Perhaps I’d be invited to lie down, on the kind of bed they have in doctors’ offices. And perhaps a special camera would be lowered over my face, and I’d be told not to move while an enormous glass lens dilated and constricted above me.</p>
<p>Standing there in Yin’s office, I realized that what I’d been imagining was a larger and more intrusive version of the X-ray machine dentists use, with a camera pointed not toward some part of my jaw, but toward my whole face—a camera that was correspondingly larger. This strange anxiety-fantasy vanished instantly as Yin’s graduate student gestured toward a table holding an open laptop. I looked at it. It showed a video feed of myself and the grad student staring into the laptop’s webcam.</p>
<p>“What is this?” I asked.</p>
<p>“This is it,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It is capturing your face.”</p>
<p>“When? Now?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. He looked at Yin. They both smiled.</p>
<p>I examined the screen more carefully. There was my face. But it was different. A blue highlight appeared over my left eye, like an eyebrow scrawled in marker on the screen. A green highlight appeared over my right eye. And a wavering white stripe, like something my five-year-old daughter might draw—hesitant, wobbly—circled the shape of my face. Some numbers flickered on the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>“This is it,” I repeated.</p>
<p>The effect was vaguely cartoonish. It reminded me of a certain genre of TV ad; I thought dimly of soda commercials, or maybe running shoes, ads in which bright pastel colors scribble over dancing consumers.</p>
<p>But, remembering what I’d read about the technology, I realized that this cartoon effect emerged from something like the polar opposite of a marketer’s mind. Those pastel colors were the expression of a deeply alien process, a truly inhuman perspective on the human face.</p>
<p>What I was looking at as I stared at my concentrating face on the screen, I realized, was a trace of the way the machine saw me. The cartoon highlights, the wavering white outline, the numbers—these were the visible sign of the machine’s digestion of my human features into a code, a set of coordinates, a faceprint.</p>
<p>“What are those numbers?” I asked.</p>
<p>Two slowly ascending digits flickered in the upper left corner of the screen, like a reverse countdown: 81. 83. 86.</p>
<p>“That is the match,” he said.</p>
<p>He explained that the numbers showed the degree to which the current image of my face matched other instances of my face in the database.</p>
<p>I watched the number climb into the nineties. The machine was learning to recognize me.</p>
<p>The scene in Yin’s office represents the third time in my life that my face had been captured for a use beyond its standard social function. We can distinguish between these two ways of using my face by distinguishing between an interest in expression and an interest in non-expression.</p>
<p>The regime of expression includes photographic captures of my face ranging from family or elementary school class photos to television appearances. In each of these cases, the “users” of my face desire expression. They want to see my face emitting a true or false (this distinction doesn’t matter in most cases) rendering of a prosocial inner state. My family wants to see me smiling happily in the school photo. The TV interviewer wants to see me engaged in serious thought or conversation.</p>
<p>But in Yin’s office, during my third encounter with the non-expressive regime, none of this mattered. The point here wasn’t for me to perform some inner state, but simply for the software to identify me. My second encounter with this regime had been at the CVS when my passport photo was taken. It is probably true that there have been other times—when my previous passport photos were taken, or when I posed for my driver’s-license photo—that were also instances of interest in my non-expressive face. But if so, I was confused about this at the time, and treated each photographing as an expressive scenario, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>But the first time I encountered this regime, I didn’t smile, and I was not confused. This was when my mug shot was taken in a Chicago jail in 2002, after I had been arrested for felony possession of narcotics.</p>
<p>“Stand over there,” a cop commanded. “And look over here. Give me your glasses.”</p>
<p>“My glasses?”</p>
<p>He pulled me toward him and snatched my glasses off my face. He then half closed them, and brought the two stems—which made a kind of miniature vise—to bear on my throat. He pressed, hard.</p>
<p>“You see?” he said. “You see this is a weapon?”</p>
<p>Then he released me, glasses-less, and I stumbled backward. I heard the click of the camera, and then he took me to my cell.</p>
<p>Whatever expression that camera captured (and I’ve never seen the mug shot; when my felony was expunged a couple years later, they sent me my fingerprints in the mail, but not the mug shot), whatever expression I wore—dazed, blinking sightless at broad planes of gray and white jail-color—was not intentional. Perhaps it was in a sense the most authentic image of my face ever captured. At any rate, the justice system was certainly not interested in making me smile. This photo was for identification purposes only.</p>
<p>What links these three different scenes of facial capture—in Yin’s lab, in the CVS, in the West Side of Chicago jail? These different systems—the state, local, and federal police agencies; the U.S. State Department; the actual and possible end users of facial-recognition technology—are not oriented toward what is inside me. They’re not trying to capture my thoughts or feelings or words. They are oriented toward my actions.</p>
<p>Each system is designed to match a given action—a drug offense, a violation of customs or immigration law, an appearance at a party that someone is recording for an Instagram video—to a given name. My name.</p>
<p>This is the truth embedded in the term “faceprint.” It’s like a thumbprint: a pattern unique to one individual, the trace someone might leave in every space he traverses. Thinking of an image of your face as somehow analogous to your thumbprint leads to serious mental vertigo. Take a look at your thumb. Now look at your face in the mirror. Imagine your neck terminating in a giant thumb.</p>
<p>To understand how one’s face can become as neutral, as objective, as expressionless as one’s thumb, is to grasp the key difference between the regime of facial recognition and the regime of everyday expressive facial control.</p>
<p>The example of my mug shot perhaps gives an unduly negative view of the possibilities of facial recognition. The effort to view a person from a distance, to observe their actions from an external perspective, doesn’t have to be creepy. One might even think that this effort is essential to being a good person.</p>
<p>Adam Smith thought so. In his <em>Theory of Moral Sentiments,</em> he wrote that we cannot judge whether our actions are morally good or bad from within. The only way to make such a judgment is to “remove ourselves, as it were, from our own natural station,” and to “endeavour to examine our own conduct as we imagine any other fair and impartial spectator would examine it.” Smith continues:</p>
<p>I divide myself, as it were, into two persons; and that I, the examiner and judge, represent a different character from that other I, the person whose conduct is examined into and judged of. The first is the spectator, whose sentiments with regard to my own conduct I endeavor to enter into, by placing myself in his situation, and by considering how it would appear to me, when seen from that particular point of view.</p>
<p>To be a good person, one has to be able to judge the moral status of one’s actions. And to do this requires alienation. I must disembed myself from what I think and feel, pry my mind out of my face, and observe myself as a simple name and body performing certain actions.</p>
<p>I do this all the time without thinking. When my five-year-old runs into my office as I’m playing a computer game and wants me to read her a book, I feel irritated, set-upon. Probably my facial expression conveys these feelings.</p>
<p>But I also see the situation from a different perspective. I imagine a perspective outside the situation, watching me. And I imagine that this observing entity would be pleased if I stopped what I’m doing. It thinks that it would be good if I stood up, took the book the child proffers, and spent ten minutes reading it to her.</p>
<p>I want this observer to think well of me. So I perform the action that will produce this positive judgment. Afterward, my daughter leaves my office with a happy smile. And I am also smiling as I return to my game, feeling like a good father.</p>
<p>Who was this alien observer, whose gaze made me into a (slightly) better person, whose gaze (slightly) reduced my incorrigible self-centeredness? In one sense, of course, it was me. But it was a version of me identifying for the moment with an outside point of view that registers and judges my actions. The <em>outsideness</em> is crucial. This perspective doesn’t know or care what I’m thinking or feeling. It isn’t compelled by—doesn’t even recognize—the expression of irritation on my face. It doesn’t attend to my thoughts about how I’m so close to beating this one level I’ve been trying to conquer for a week. It trains its cold, alien gaze only on my actions.</p>
<p>The kind of surveillance Smith describes is a form of control. Such control isn’t intrinsically tyrannical or oppressive. Its value depends on the aims it serves. In the example with my daughter, the aim is moral goodness. Smith argues, to my mind compellingly, that there isn’t an easy way to be a good person without this kind of surveillance by another, even if that other is, in the end, only you. Of course, it’s easy—maybe even too easy—to imagine scenarios in which the observer’s aim is a bad one. <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four.</em> China. Google.</p>
<p>But is it possible, I wonder, to imagine a world in which social control operates primarily, and optimistically, through a non-expressive model? Imagine a benign government, watching you through street-mounted surveillance cameras, tracking you through your friend’s Facebook posts. Maybe it’s not going to do anything in particular with these images. Perhaps it might intervene if it looks like you’re about to harm someone. But in general it just watches. It wants you to be a good person. The imaginary regime works, in fact, like Smith’s impartial observer: the constant alien and alienated eye that alone makes it possible for a person to truly do good.</p>
<p>This thought experiment will seem fanciful to some, terrifying to others. But I want to use it as a contrast with another regime, a regime with nothing fanciful or imaginary about it. This regime may have temporarily relaxed its hold on your face as you read this. But soon—very soon—it will be manipulating those forty-three muscles again.</p>
<p>The advent of facial-recognition technology arouses unsettling feelings in part because—fancifully or terrifyingly—it opens the prospect of an alternative to the way we’ve always used faces. The emergence of an alternative gives a new perspective on the old thing, and not always a flattering one. Think of the invention of indoor plumbing.</p>
<p>So let’s take a closer look at the old thing.</p>
<p>Return to the scene with my daughter. I’m sitting in my office, playing a computer game, when she comes in holding a book, demanding I read it to her. Now, instead of my actions being tracked by Adam Smith’s impartial observer, let’s imagine a real, live person sitting there watching me. Perhaps it’s a relative. Perhaps a neighbor who’s dropped by. Perhaps a friend.</p>
<p>Like the alien, outside gaze of Smith’s observer (or AI facial-recognition software), the mere presence of this person will exert control over me. But the control wielded by the human is deeper, more intrusive. This real person is not just interested in my actions. They don’t see my face as in any way like a thumbprint, a simple means of identifying my actions. They watch my expressions.</p>
<p>They see the child run up to me. If this third person wasn’t there, my face would instinctively reflect my actual emotional state of mild irritation. But with this person watching, I can’t afford to betray my feelings by this expression. The kid wants Daddy to read her a book. What kind of father could be irritated by so charming and salutary a request? So I turn to the child with a smile. Of course I’m happy to drop what I’m doing and read her a story.</p>
<p>That smile is a razor, cutting backward into my brain. It rips my irritation to shreds. It might even destroy the memory of it. My neck and shoulder muscles tighten with the internal effort of eradicating and erasing my first, natural feeling. The face I turn to my child with is the face of a loving, smiling parent, unbothered—excited even—to be interrupted.</p>
<p>In both scenarios—the one in which I adopt the perspective of the impartial observer, and the one in which I am watched by an actual human observer—being watched changes my behavior for the better. But consider the difference.</p>
<p>In the first example, as I realize the action I should take, my frown slowly turns upside down. I expel my irritation with a sigh, as I sit the child on my lap and start to read to her. By the end, both she and I are smiling. I have become the happy, good father. But I’ve arrived at this morally desirable end point through a natural, relatively slow process in which the demands of my own self-centered feelings and inclinations were challenged, and then defeated, by a sense of how an impartial observer would judge me.</p>
<p>In the second example, I become the happy, good father instantaneously. But this good man is an artifact. He is artificial. He has been created by the human sitting in the chair across the room, who, by triggering the manipulation of my facial muscles, nullifies the expression of my natural feeling. In changing the way I appear, this person also causes a deeper change.</p>
<p>Hegel says that “the self perceives itself at the same time that it is perceived by others. . . . Self-consciousness exists . . . by the fact that it exists for another self-consciousness.” I become myself by identifying with the object you see. And what you—you other human beings—mainly see is my face. As the psychologist Silvan Tomkins writes, “the self lives in the face”:</p>
<p>Both transmission and reception of communicated information take place at the face. The mouth talks, the eyes perceive; and the movements of the facial musculature are uniquely related to one’s experienced affects and to the affects transmitted to others.</p>
<p>All of us, pretty much all the time, want others to see us as a good object. Since our sense of ourself depends so highly on the attitudes of others, we instantly, preemptively, and constantly work the forty-three muscles of our face to produce the expected response—the response that will please or impress others. This dynamic is so pervasive and unremitting that it can be hard to bring it to consciousness.</p>
<p>An offhand comment that William S. Burroughs makes in <em>Naked Lunch</em> illuminates the way others shape us from an unexpected angle. A character in the novel says you can learn more about someone by <em>talking</em> to them than by <em>listening</em> to them. How could this be? Because the part of our mind that learns about someone’s attitudes by listening to their words is inferior in its cognitive power to the part of our mind that grasps their attitude from a thousand tiny cues—their clothing, their posture, the precise modulations of their own facial muscles—and then responds to this information by working our own tone of voice, word choice, and facial expressions to produce the impression they expect.</p>
<p>When I enter a room and find my wife talking on the phone, I can almost always identify the person with whom she is speaking, even though I can’t hear anything the other person says. I simply listen to how my wife talks and I know. She has a special tone of voice, and special facial expressions, when her auditor is her mother. A different facial and vocal suite when she’s speaking to her friend John. Still another when she’s speaking to my daughter’s teacher at school.</p>
<p>I’m the same way. Am I conscious that I’m a slightly different person when I’m speaking to my friend Dave versus when I’m speaking to my friend Jason? Not normally. But now, when I’m thinking about this problem, when I’m listening to myself speak, I hear the difference.</p>
<p>We’ve examined the paranoia of the non-expressive regime of facial recognition. But there is also a paranoia of the expressive regime. “We can consider ourselves as ‘slaves,’ ” writes Sartre, “insofar as we appear to the Other.” A gaze tuned only to my actions—a gaze that sees my face as a kind of thumbprint—exerts control over what I do. But it leaves the space within me free. It doesn’t control what I think or how I feel. The machine recognizes facial structure but not facial expression. Such a gaze allows me the possibility of naturally coming to identify with the actions it encourages or pressures me to take—as when my feelings about reading to my child change from an initial irritation to eventual joy.</p>
<p>Even in a surveillance regime controlled by users who don’t want me to be a good person, but merely compliant—a tool of their own power—my interior remains relatively free. I can do one thing while thinking and feeling and perhaps planning another.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s also possible to do this in an expressive regime. I can smile while hating you. But the pressure is greater. People are adept at detecting the little blips in facial manipulation that indicates someone’s faking it. Over time, it becomes easier to simply feel what your face expresses.</p>
<p>“The self perceives itself at the same time that it is perceived by others.” Who am I? A real person, watched by artificial eyes? Or an artificial person, watched by real eyes?</p>
<p>I close my own eyes and see my face on the screen in Yin’s office. The pastel colors smudge like cartoon eyebrows. My expression—baffled, then interested.</p>
<p>I feel Yin’s eyes on me. I smile.</p>
<p>The digits on the left side of the screen ascend.</p>

<h1 id="how-new-yorks-tenants-won"><strong>How New York’s Tenants Won</strong></h1>
<p>By Tara Raghuveer </p>
<p>The night before the New York City municipal primary, the air was sticky with heat and Ferdousi Begum was too tense to sleep. For the past six months, Begum—a sixty-nine-year-old Bengali immigrant living in a rent-stabilized twenty-unit apartment building in Astoria—had been canvasing in support of Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral campaign with her seventy-one-year-old husband, Parveg Hasan. They had been visiting small businesses, mosques, subway stations, and schools in their neighborhood. “Whenever we found another Bengali, we would engage in conversation,” Hasan told me. “We would start with <em>Salaam. What is your name? Are you a tenant?</em>” </p>
<p>Begum and Hasan have lived in Astoria for seven years. He works late nights selling food from halal carts, mostly in midtown Manhattan; she runs the household they share with their forty-year-old son. They got involved in tenant organizing four years ago, after Begum came across a meeting of the Astoria Tenants Union in a nearby park. She soon joined the group that had convened the meeting, the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (CAAAV), founded in 1986 to bring together working-class Asian immigrant communities in Manhattan and western Queens to organize for racial and economic justice.</p>
<p>Some time later she invited Hasan to join. At first he was skeptical, concerned about the work’s potential repercussions, but after several months he “saw it was worth the risk.” Since then the two have been active in the tenant union together, bringing in neighbors one by one. “I tell everyone about organizing. I speak to my friends, family, neighbors about the importance of growing our power,” Begum told me via an interpreter. “Many people come because of me.”</p>
<p>The couple spent months focused on helping Mamdani win. “For us it’s about being able to live in this city,” Begum explained. “The reality is we stay in this city even though we struggle to live here. There’s easy transportation, Bengali groceries. It’s possible to find work…but it’s not possible to make ends meet. Rent is the number one killer. The whole community is suffering.” </p>
<p>On election day Begum got out of bed at 5 AM. By 7 she and Hasan had arrived at the offices of CAAAV Voice, the group’s political sibling organization and a member of the New York State Tenant Bloc, a coalition working to channel tenants’ political power. The members divvied up doors to knock, phone numbers to call, and polling stations to observe. Begum and Hasan got out on the doors themselves, knocked until it got too hot, went home to shower, and returned to the office to phonebank. At 6 PM they joined their neighbors for a last push: three hours of outreach in the park and on the streets, running people to the polls if they hadn’t voted. Hasan got someone there with two minutes to spare.</p>
<p>Just over an hour after polls closed, and about a week before anyone expected real results, Andrew Cuomo, New York’s embattled ex-governor, conceded. Mamdani—a thirty-three-year-old Democratic Socialist assemblymember representing parts of Astoria, Astoria Heights, and Ditmars-Steinway in Queens—took the stage after midnight at his watch party in Long Island City and declared victory. Begum and Hasan had just left the CAAAV Voice office; they were at home, refreshing their phones, when they saw the results. They both slept well that night.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>To understand how Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral primary by a full 12 points last month, shocking the political establishment in the city and across the country, it helps to understand how tenants like Begum and Hasan decided to go on the offensive against real estate.</p>
<p>There are a number of places where the story could start. Over the last several decades a historic amount of capital has flowed into investments in residential and commercial properties around the world. A complex system of institutions emerged to protect and increase that flow, from real estate trusts to private equity firms.</p>
<p>New York is that system’s global center. As Michael Greenberg has documented <a href="https://archive.is/o/DWPbc/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/08/17/tenants-under-siege-inside-new-york-city-housing-crisis/">in these pages</a>, between 2000 and 2016 survival became nearly impossible for the city’s poorest tenants. During those years, he wrote, New York City developers “contributed $83 million to state assembly and senate campaigns, more than any other economic group.” In Albany legislators routinely blocked pro-tenant bills from reaching the floor. At City Hall Michael Bloomberg’s twelve-year tenure initiated an era of glitzy projects and subsidies, which were billed as incentives for the creation of affordable housing but were in practice sweeteners for developers.</p>
<p>Bloomberg’s successor, Bill de Blasio, criticized him for expanding an underclass, what he called “the other New York.” During his term he oversaw three rent freezes for tenants in the city’s one million rent-stabilized units, but otherwise he followed a playbook on housing that too often resembled Bloomberg’s. Catastrophic tax exemptions and neighborhood-by-neighborhood rezoning led to a speculation boom and skyrocketing rents.</p>
<p>One inflection point came in late 2018, when then-governor Cuomo championed a deal that would have brought Amazon’s second headquarters—a billion-dollar development project—to Long Island City. “HQ2,” as it became known, was to include a waterfront esplanade and enough office space to fill three Empire State Buildings. It was also set to receive nearly $3 billion in subsidies.</p>
<p>After the bid went public, a coalition of grassroots groups—many of which I know in my capacity as an organizer with the national Tenant Union Federation—rallied to oppose the project. The central question was rent. At the time Queens was already the site of the steepest rent hikes in the country, and many tenants feared that the HQ2 project would supercharge gentrification across the borough.</p>
<p>“Our members saw the writing on the wall,” Sasha Wijeyeratne, the executive director of CAAAV and CAAAV Voice, told me. “They knew that an influx of wealthy Amazon employees would raise rents, and the cost of everything else around them, and that the local bodegas, restaurants, and laundromats would be priced out.” Responding to public pressure, politicians like Corey Johnson—then speaker of the city council—and councilmember Jimmy van Bramer came out against the deal. “Why do you need our money? We have 63,000 people who are sleeping in homeless shelters,” Johnson asked. “Don’t you think there is a better way for us to spend $3 billion?” Community members booed Amazon representatives out of a city council meeting.</p>
<p>The pressure proved too much. In February 2019, three months after announcing the development, Amazon backed out. Organizers declared victory, but they were sober about the likelihood of the movement’s ongoing success: if it wasn’t HQ2 it would be another megadevelopment. During that time, Wijeyrante told me, tenant organizations began to have more sustained conversations about how to escape these reactive fights.</p>

<p>Tactics are what organizers do; strategy is why we do them. The tenant leaders, Wijeyrante suggested, felt a need to sharpen their long-term strategy. One way was to clarify precisely what they were up against—not just individual landlords or management companies but the system of real estate and financial institutions that collaborate to set the terms of the market and influence policy in their favor. “We began zeroing in on real estate capital as the enemy,” Wijeyrante said. “We needed to make that money toxic.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In New York, landlords and real estate capitalists exercise power through a lobbying group called the Real Estate Board of New York. “REBNY exerts vast influence over the New York institutions that shape public policy,” the longtime tenant organizer Cea Weaver told me, “from the City Council to the Rent Guidelines Board to the state legislature—all in service of their bottom line.”</p>
<p>Weaver leads Housing Justice for All, a statewide coalition founded in 2017 that brings together over eighty tenant organizations, including CAAAV. In 2019, when she signed on as the coalition’s first full-time staff member, she drove across the state to recruit organizations from Buffalo to the Mohawk Valley and organized busloads of tenants to go to the state capitol. They were campaigning for the passage of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act, which would make rent protections a permanent feature in New York’s housing law, expand rent control, and restrict landlords’ ability to exploit loopholes to escape regulation. That June the law passed—a landmark victory.</p>
<p>The win would not have been possible without a new crop of legislators. In 2018 a coalition of seven candidates, one of them put up by a resurgent Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and six by the Working Families Party (WFP), had primaried and defeated members of the Independent Democratic Caucus—a group of Democrats who had started caucusing with their Republican colleagues, often against the interests of the working class, including opposing rent stabilization. (Among the successful challengers were two candidates in this year’s mayoral election, Jessica Ramos and Zellnor Myrie.) The DSA candidate, Julia Salazar, pledged not to take campaign contributions from developers and landlords and ran on a platform that stressed her support for rent control. This influx of new lawmakers produced “not just a functional Democratic majority in the state senate,” the writer and urban planner Samuel Stein <a href="https://archive.is/o/DWPbc/https://jacobin.com/2019/06/new-york-housing-tenants-universal-rent-control">wrote at the time</a>, “but a group of reformers in office with strong allegiances to tenants and the tenant movement.”</p>
<p>Even so, the organizers felt outpaced by the real estate industry and underprepared to sustain their achievements. “As long as I’ve been a tenant organizer, I’ve been told real estate in New York is like oil in Texas,” Sumathy Kumar, the campaign director at Housing Justice for All, told me. “This is how power works in this state. They just throw their money around everywhere. It’s not just that so many politicians are taking their money, it’s also that they think they might start funding against them if they do anything pro-tenant. Electeds are terrified.”</p>
<p>In 2022 another proposed development drew the movement’s attention. That spring Silverstein Properties, BedRock Real Estate Partners, and Kaufman Astoria Studios petitioned the City Council’s Land Use Committee to approve a development project called Innovation QNS. It involved rezoning a five-block manufacturing district to build 3,200 housing units in Astoria, a neighborhood in Mamdani’s district where 87 percent of the residents were then tenants, <a href="https://archive.is/o/DWPbc/https://astoriapost.com/council-member-julie-won-innovation-queens-leaves-neighborhood-behind">nearly 70 percent</a> of them either rent burdened or severely rent burdened (which is to say, spending over half their incomes on rent). The proposal barely met the legal minimum requirement that 25 percent of its units be affordable—a standard that rarely creates truly affordable housing in any case, having more to do with what a developer can afford to build than with what a tenant can afford to pay.</p>
<p>CAAAV, Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM), and Queensbridge Houses residents collaborated with the DSA, Queens Neighborhood Union, and other organizations to defeat the proposal. Among their supporters was Mamdani, then two years into his term as a state assemblymember in Albany and a steady ally of the tenant movement. (The previous year he had gotten arrested during a protest at Cadman Plaza calling for a pandemic eviction moratorium.) Now he spoke at protests and gave comments to the press, flanked by signs with slogans like OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ≠ YOUR PIGGY BANK. “I am in firm opposition to this proposal,” he tweeted that June. “My opposition does not stem from its proposed density…. It is entirely because of the absolute paucity of affordable housing within this proposal. To build 2,120 market rate units with a set aside of only the legal minimum of 25 percent affordability is not an answer to this housing crisis—it is a cause.”</p>
<p>Ultimately the tenant-led coalition, with sustained support from Mamdani, forced the developer to deepen the project’s affordability requirements. Of the total Innovation QNS units, 1,100 would now be income-restricted; of those, five hundred would be rented at 30 percent of the area median income, which would make them available to individuals earning around $28,020 a year or families of four making $40,020 a year. It was a significant concession. If tenants were to go on the offensive in the coming years, it seemed, Mamdani was a promising early draft pick.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Last year CAAAV Voice convened a team of tenants from across the city to develop a proposal for a campaign to win a citywide rent freeze for rent-stabilized units, which they saw as a step on the path to universal rent control. They weren’t alone. Other organizations involved with Housing Justice for All—including Community Action for Safe Apartments (CASA), Housing Conservation Coordinators, Tenants &amp; Neighbors, the Metropolitan Council on Housing, and New York Communities for Change (NYCC)—were considering similar options.</p>
<p>It was a sign of a broader strategic shift. In Albany, a mighty backlash against the Covid-era eviction moratorium had helped REBNY regain ground after the tenants’ 2019 victory. In April 2024 “good cause” eviction protections, which Housing Justice for All had spent years fighting to codify, finally passed, but the coalition was forced to accept major compromises—including exemptions that left millions of tenants unprotected. Finding themselves on the back foot at the state legislature, they knew they needed to try something new. Within the movement, leaders started talking more seriously about an electoral strategy that would put organized tenants face-to-face with organized capital.</p>
<p>At the city level, meanwhile, the Rent Guidelines Board—a nine-member body appointed by the mayor and charged with setting rents for the city’s rent-stabilized units—had become increasingly hostile to low-income tenants over the course of Eric Adams’s tenure, raising rents twice in as many years. When the board voted through a third raise that June, a group of a hundred tenants, organized by the Rent Justice Coalition, protested the decision at Cooper Union and got arrested. Mamdani was among them.</p>

<p>Three months later he reached out to CAAAV Voice and asked them to be among the groups that would endorse his candidacy on the day he announced his run for mayor. Soon thereafter, as CAAAV Voice’s organizing director Alina Shen recounted to me, she found herself in an elevator at the CUNY Labor Center with Fahd Ahmed, the executive director of DRUM Beats, the political sibling to DRUM. She asked, “Hey, are you going to endorse? We need to make a call.” By the end of the day they were in a group chat with organizers at NYCC. The next week they decided to run a joint endorsement process.</p>
<p>On October 21 over two hundred people affiliated with the trio of groups gathered at the NYCC offices with interpreters in four languages to pose questions to Ramos, Mamdani, and, over Zoom, Brad Lander. Mamdani might have seemed the clear choice: at the time he was the only candidate willing to commit to a rent freeze. But endorsing him was neither obvious nor risk-free: he had virtually no name recognition, and the crowded field included some longer-running and more experienced progressive champions, like Lander, who had deep relationships with institutions like the WFP.</p>
<p>Nor were tenants willing to line up behind Mamdani uncritically. When Mr. Chen, an elder with the Chinatown Tenant Union, questioned Mamdani, Shen recounted to me, the candidate greeted him with a friendly “Ni hao.” Chen, uncharmed, held eye contact and told him, “We need reassurance you are not going to leave us behind as you ascend. You need to see how we live.” After the meeting Mr. Chen followed Mamdani out of the room and made sure they scheduled a day for him to visit the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But in the end Mamdani’s commitment to a rent freeze won out: each group agreed to endorse him on day one. “Every politician says New York is the greatest city on the globe,” Mamdani said in his launch video on October 23. “But what good is that if no one can afford to live here?… This is New York. We can afford to dream.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In January the Housing Justice for All coalition launched a statewide electoral arm called the Tenant Bloc, which counts CAAAV Voice, DRUM Beats, and NYCC as members. It was an experiment in activating what the Cornell geographer Russell Weaver—no relation to Cea—has called the “sleeping giant” in New York politics: tenants as a political class. “Tenants are half the state,” the group declared. They could be a dominant political force—if they organized themselves “from the buildings to the ballot box.”</p>
<p>The group’s first major undertaking was a campaign to build support for a citywide rent freeze. The mayoral race was a natural occasion: organizers started knocking doors across the city, asking tenants to sign a pledge that they would vote for a candidate who supported the policy. Rather than back Mamdani from the get-go, as several of their members had, they hoped to build a base they could route toward whichever candidate they ultimately endorsed, applying pressure to the whole field in the process.</p>
<p>Among the campaign’s co-chairs was Joanne Grell, a Puerto Rican single mother of two who lives in a rent-stabilized apartment in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx, where she serves as president of the tenant association. She found the apartment on Craigslist twenty-four years ago, when her kids were two and five and she was freshly separated from her husband. It is a spacious two-bedroom in a thirty-two-unit prewar building, with a big kitchen and one tiny bathroom. She raised her kids there and put them both through college; now one is in medical school and the other just had a film premiere at Sundance. “None of this could have been accomplished,” she told me, “without stabilized rent.”</p>
<p>In 2020 Grell went back to college, attending classes at night while working her job as an executive legal assistant at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital by day. One of her assignments, for a class on community organizing, was to observe an organization’s meeting; she chose one hosted by CASA, based on the other side of the Bronx. When she went to the meeting, she felt that it was “home for me,” she said. “I thought, you know what? My building does need repairs, we have common complaints, let me start a tenant association.” Before long she had recruited all of her building’s residents. “I read a story that said one in twenty-four New Yorkers was a millionaire and I was like <em>wait</em>—this is becoming the land of the rich,” she told me. “We have to hold on with both hands.”</p>
<p>This past January REBNY held its annual fundraiser, a $2,500-per-plate affair at a waterfront venue in Hell’s Kitchen. Kathy Hochul gave remarks; among the honorees was Scott Rechler, CEO of the firm RXR Realty, which owns thousands of residential units in New York. Outside the venue the newly formed Tenant Bloc organized a picket they called the People’s Gala—Grell wore pearls and borrowed a full-length fur coat from her neighbor to look the part. To the rhythm of a bucket drum, the crowd chanted “UP, UP WITH TENANT POWER/DOWN, DOWN WITH REAL ESTATE,” greeting landlords on their way into a banquet funded by their tenants’ rent checks.</p>
<p>The Tenant Bloc’s strategy involved more than just this kind of confrontation. It built a field operation that included over seven hundred volunteers and twenty-five field leads who knocked doors in every part of the city, collecting 20,646 pledges from rent-stabilized tenants to support a mayor who backed a rent freeze. In May the bloc formally endorsed Mamdani. A week later they gathered more than a thousand tenants for a rally at Riverside Church. Between the endorsement and the primary they sent tens of thousands of texts and placed tens of thousands of calls to get out the vote.</p>
<p>The component organizations of the Tenant Bloc ran their own operations. At the height of their activity CAAAV Voice was in five neighborhoods—Sunnyside, Astoria, Jamaica, Sunset Park, and Chinatown—nine times a week. Tenants like Parveg Hasan went to mosques every Friday to recruit voters. Elisa Martinez, a young tenant who grew up in Washington Heights, canvased her neighborhood with a focus on the Dominican community, which accounts for 15 percent of the city’s rent-stabilized tenants. Delsenia Glover, the president of the historic Lenox Terrace Tenant Association in Harlem, organized her building to sign on to the campaign. Grell told me about a tenant named Mercedes, a retired social worker, who built a crew to take the petitions to college campuses. The bloc’s call for a rent freeze—and to rank Zohran first on the ballot—broke into Whatsapp group chats and ethnic media, including <em>El Diario</em>, Bangla TV, and the <em>World Journal</em>, the largest Chinese newspaper in the US.</p>
<p>Predictably, real estate power players found their own ways to engage in the mayoral race. Last year two long-standing landlord lobbying groups merged to form the New York Apartment Association. (Its inaugural CEO, Kenny Burgos, is a thirty-one-year-old former assemblymember who makes <a href="https://archive.is/o/DWPbc/https://hellgatenyc.com/kenny-burgos-nyaa-landlord-tiktok-social-media-videos/">landlord-friendly TikToks</a> and attended high school with Mamdani.) In June, as Mamdani rose in the polls, the NYAA announced that it would spend $2.5 million to support Cuomo via a Super PAC called Housing for All—at the time the single largest donation in the mayoral election cycle. </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The election was supposed to be about crime. Eric Adams had won the office in 2021 on a law-and-order agenda, and when Andrew Cuomo entered the race it was with a platform to “make New York safer and more respectful of others.” (He committed, among other things, to increasing the police force by 15 percent.) But over the course of the campaign it became clear that Mamdani’s focus on the cost of living was resonating—and that the single biggest threat to the city’s affordability, the biggest line-item in working-class New Yorkers’ monthly budgets, was rent. When the day-one endorsers got behind Mamdani, he was the only candidate supporting a rent freeze. By the last weeks of the primary the Tenant Bloc, along with the pressure of Mamdani’s skyrocketing success in the polls, had moved six more candidates—Brad Lander, Adrienne Adams, Zellnor Myrie, Jessica Ramos, Michael Blake, and Scott Stringer—to join him.</p>
<p>Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis/Getty Images</p>
<p>Zohran Mamdani getting ready to hold his rally at Brooklyn Steel, May 4, 2025</p>
<p>For his part, Mamdani did an elegant dance on housing. “I’ve already told you about my commitment to freeze the rent for every single rent-stabilized tenant,” he told the camera, standing on Atlantic Avenue in a February video, tall residential buildings looming behind him. “But what about the other half?” For them, he went on, “we need more housing—a lot more.” In his platform he promised to “triple the amount of housing built with City capital funds,” including by significantly expanding the city’s Senior Affordable Rental Apartments and Extremely Low and Low-Income Affordability programs, which subsidize the construction of affordable housing for seniors and low-income households, respectively. At the same time, he also threw his support behind such measures as upzoning wealthy neighborhoods, eliminating parking lot requirements, and encouraging housing growth “around subway stations and other public transit hubs,” policies that many developers might favor more than they do his slate of tenant protections.</p>
<p>In a city fraught with smug and unproductive housing discourse—including plenty of bad-faith online screaming by YIMBYs and NIMBYs alike—Mamdani suggested that we might not have to choose between support for tenant protections on the one hand and zoning reform on the other. In an “ask me anything” session on Reddit this past April, one participant asked him whether he agreed or disagreed that “market-rate development is helpful and good, and we should encourage more of it.” His response was deft:</p>
<p>Agree that we need a LOT more housing of all kinds, and in my housing plan, I call for increased zoning capacity around transit hubs, upzoning wealthy neighborhoods, and fully eliminating the parking mandate citywide…. I led with city capital–funded affordable housing…for two reasons: 1) I want to be held accountable to outcomes, but that’s hard to do when it comes to piecemeal rezonings that are essentially just an invitation to private developers 2) we’re a long ways off from for-profit developers building deeply affordable housing at scale. That’s where the greatest emergency is, and it requires a public-sector approach. Mine will be a pro-housing administration, and it will be one that understands the importance of all kinds of housing growth so that we can meet the scale of this crisis.</p>
<p>The top-line item, however, never changed. In May the campaign released a thirty-second spot that ran for ten days as their main advertisement both on digital platforms and television, including during Knicks games during the team’s playoff bid. It begins with Mamdani jogging down a residential block. Looking straight into the camera, he declares: “I’m running for mayor to freeze the rent for every rent-stabilized tenant.” Block letters appear on the face of a building: FREEZE THE RENT. Cut to the building—it’s Grell’s. She walks out in a jean jacket. “Yes,” she says, “this guy’s gonna freeze the rent.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Mamdani’s win wasn’t marginal—it was a mandate. When the New York City Board of Elections released the primary’s ranked-choice voting results, they showed him defeating Andrew Cuomo by 56 to 44 percent. Mamdani swept parts of the city that would be affected by the rent freeze. As Charlie Dulik has shown in a <a href="https://archive.is/o/DWPbc/https://nysfocus.com/2025/07/04/renters-tenants-zohran-mamdani-victory">recent article</a> for <em>NY Focus</em>, he won more first-round votes than Cuomo in seven of the ten assembly districts with the largest share of rent-stabilized units—districts that include much of Astoria, Long Island City, Inwood, Washington Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, central Harlem, and Chelsea, as well as parts of Flatbush and Midtown. Compared to the last municipal election, turnout in tenant-majority areas rose by 7.5 percent. </p>
<p>Real estate is not used to losing in New York. On the Wednesday after the primary, in a sign of investor panic over the Mamdani effect, publicly traded landlords with portfolios concentrated in the city sustained <a href="https://archive.is/o/DWPbc/https://www.bisnow.com/new-york/news/economy/nyc-cre-reeling-after-mamdani-wins-mayoral-primary-129923">hits to their stock prices</a>: SL Green’s dropped by 5.7 percent, Vornado Realty Trust’s by 6.7 percent, and Empire State Realty Trust’s by over 7.5 percent. The industry, which had invested millions into Cuomo’s campaign directly and through various Super PACs, had to reassess its approach.</p>
<p>Some important players are threatening to move their business dealings to Florida. Others have lined up behind Eric Adams, who once proclaimed, “I am real estate.” Two weeks after the election Marc Holliday, the CEO of SL Green, hosted a fundraiser for Adams at One Madison Avenue, one of his office towers. Rechler, the RXR CEO, who also sits on REBNY’s board, took a jab: “New York is the capital of capitalism, and it seems inappropriate to have a socialist mayor in a city like ours.”</p>
<p>On June 30, meanwhile, the Rent Guidelines Board met for their annual hearing and voted through their fourth consecutive rent hike under Adams. Grell was among the tenants who gathered to protest. “This is nothing but a political payback from real estate mayor Eric Adams,” she told the crowd. “He’s mad we…helped Zohran win just one week ago. And now his RGB is trying to use their power to punish us, working class tenants. Why? Because we’re building something that they cannot control: tenant power.”</p>
<p>Mamdani’s victory in the primary was so decisive that it can now seem preordained. But as recently as six months ago he was an unknown and the rent, as a political matter, was a third rail. Tenants and Mamdani took a bet on each other. Mamdani’s gamble, rare in politics, was to stand for a controversial policy proposal—a rent freeze—and make an early, unwavering commitment to his chosen team: working-class tenants. Tenants, for their part, were taking a chance on a new kind of power, funneling time and resources into electoral campaigning rather than the familiar terrain of legislative advocacy. Both those choices carried risks, and neither was assured of success in advance.</p>
<p>For now the tenants still have a city to win. Everyone I spoke to felt that the offensive had just begun, that the movement could afford neither to let up on the outside pressure nor abdicate its responsibility to govern. After the win Hasan deflected questions about his reaction to the results. Instead he focused on what comes next. “There’s a big fight ahead, now through November,” he told me. “And the election is not the end. We must be disciplined. We must remember our enemy. We must build our power. We need to fight until we win a rent freeze. And then we need to fight more.”</p>

<p>By Charlie Dulik </p>
<hr>
<p>More than a third of the US population rent their homes. The number of tenants in the country is growing fast—nearly triple the rate of homeowner growth in 2024. So, too, are the challenges they face. Tenants headed into 2025 having experienced the steepest four-year rent hike on record. Nearly half of their households, as of 2023, the most recent year for which data is available, are rent burdened, paying over 30 percent of their income toward rent and utilities, with more than a quarter paying over half. Both statistics are all-time highs. Those unable to afford these hikes, no longer protected by the federal programs that emerged briefly during the Covid-19 pandemic, have joined the growing population of homeless people in America—another number at a record high. Housing accounted for 70 percent of inflation throughout 2024. </p>
<p>Low- and, increasingly, middle-income tenants must choose between paying record rents in major cities or moving to areas with cheaper apartments but worse job markets and fewer social services. These shifts are both regional—toward the Sun Belt or Midwest—and local, to the outer rings of cities and beyond. In the last decade exurban population growth has outpaced urban growth by roughly 7 percent. This development has in turn transformed the suburbs, traditionally considered bastions of homeownership: the growth of renter households in cities like Dallas, Minneapolis, Boston, Tampa, and Baltimore has paled in comparison to the rise of renters in their suburban peripheries. A record number of Americans, in other words, are paying increasingly large portions of their income to compete for a shrinking number of deteriorating apartments spread farther apart. </p>
<p>Donald Trump’s first six months back in office, true to his landlord roots, have subjected tenants to still more arbitrary whims. A January attempt at a government-wide spending freeze <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-housing-officials-blame-late-section-8-rent-payments-on-federal-disarray">reportedly</a> caused serious delays in Section 8 voucher payments for thousands of low-income New Yorkers. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act boosts tax credits for new development, but many of the administration’s other moves stand to diminish that change’s effect. Aggressive tariffs on <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-says-he-will-announce-25-steel-aluminum-tariffs-monday-2025-02-09/">steel and aluminum</a> will impede the construction of affordable housing by raising the price of imported materials, as fluctuating proposals threaten to do on the Mexican lime and gypsum used for over <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/02/economy/canada-tariffs-wood-lumber-housing/index.html">70 percent</a> of drywall and the <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.axios.com/2025/01/31/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-fruit-lumber">Canadian lumber</a> that makes up some 30 percent of the country’s supply. Labor stands to become more scarce as well: about <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.constructiondive.com/news/construction-workers-undocumented-presidential-election/729556/%23:~:text=Construction%20has%20an%20open%20secret,the%20Center%20for%20American%20Progress.">a fifth of the country’s construction</a> workforce is estimated to be undocumented and thus subject to the Trump administration’s crackdowns. (These mass deportations, Trump promised on the campaign trail, would ease housing demand and open up supply.) The administration rolled back a civil rights–era fair housing statute as part of a broader pledge to “protect the suburbs.” The National Low Income Housing Coalition has estimated that the country is currently short 7.3 million affordable and available rental homes for low-income tenants. The nation’s most famous developer remains, it seems, largely uninterested in facilitating their development.</p>
<p>Trump’s initial 2026 spending request threatens the nation’s most vulnerable renters with further cuts to the thin federal safety net. That proposal calls for reducing operating costs and capital funding for public housing by up to 50 percent (the system already has a repairs backlog of nearly $80 billion), cutting 43 percent of funding for federal housing vouchers (affecting over one million households), and weakening protections and enforcement. Many of these tenants had put their faith in Trump: counties with the toughest housing markets saw the largest vote shift in his direction this past November, as did people in demographic groups—like Black and Latino Americans and young people—most likely to be renters (though polling suggests that these groups are beginning to sour on the president).</p>
<p>Not all tenants, however, have reacted to hardship by turning toward the right. A growing number have joined or formed tenant organizations in the hopes of building collective political power—in the home, in the community, and on the national stage. There are now several hundred such organizations across the country. On the most basic level, they represent collectives fighting landlords or struggling for policy changes across neighborhoods, cities, and states—or both. They take a number of forms and names: associations, alliances, coalitions, committees, communities, councils, and, most often, unions. (“Leagues” fell out of fashion somewhere between the world wars.) They might have a service-oriented arm, providing legal representation or mutual aid, and some work in collaboration with labor groups: the Connecticut Tenants Union and SEIU 1199 New England are formal partners sharing technical and financial assistance. </p>
<p>They pick a range of fights, from local battles against squalid living conditions to multibillion-dollar proposals to finance affordable housing. Especially after the pandemic, a number of tenant unions across the country have experimented with ambitious campaigns. In New York a statewide group known as the Tenant Bloc—I work at one of its member organizations—launched an effort to organize 20,000 tenants in favor of a rent freeze across the five boroughs, pushing mayoral candidates to support the policy; seven major candidates eventually did. Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, the policy’s most outspoken champion, won the Democratic nomination on a wave of <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.nybooks.com/online/2025/07/22/how-new-yorks-tenants-won/">support from renters</a>. In the aftermath of wildfires in Los Angeles, members of LATU, the citywide tenant union, immediately began exposing illegal rent gouging, prompting otherwise negligent governmental bodies to crack down on offending landlords: the state and city launched seven criminal or civil suits against price-gougers, not including other subpoenas and injunctions. </p>
<p>But no matter how much strength organizations build in major cities, the scale of the housing crisis demands a national response. In August 2024 organizations in Kansas City, Connecticut, Louisville, Bozeman, and on the south side of Chicago formed the Tenant Union Federation (TUF), a self-described “union of unions.” Straightaway the new group started organizing a nationally coordinated rent strike—the first ever, TUF thought—aiming both to win much-needed repairs and to establish national rent caps in federally financed buildings. The campaign failed in its broader aims, but it represents a significant development in the tenant movement: a renewed focus on a nationwide strategy.</p>
<p>The question is how tenants can put that precedent to use. The movement remains relatively small and concentrated in major cities; its size can create a tension between ambition and effectiveness. A bold plan to invest billions in constructing green social housing across the country might alleviate the suffering of many renters, but right now it appears unlikely. On the other hand, organizing a rent strike against a landlord who fails to keep the boiler running in winter may prove both worthy and winnable, but its reach is limited. For that matter, protections that may be desperately necessary in one city might be long-established in another. How can tenants thread the needle between meeting the full scope of the crisis and mounting campaigns they have the power to win?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Tenant organization in America has a spotty history. Some tenants took collective action before the turn of the twentieth century; in upstate New York between 1839 and 1845, for instance, the <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.nybooks.com/online/2021/10/25/anti-rent-wars-then-and-now/">Anti-Renters</a> donned crude Native American costumes to tar, feather, and torment large agrarian landowners and their agents, eventually winning significant reforms in a new state constitution. Tenant activity exploded as industrialized cities teemed with swollen tenements and the working poor were forced into decrepit, overcrowded apartments with no protections against rent hikes or evictions. </p>
<p>Beginning in 1904 New York City was rocked by waves of large-scale rent strikes and vast, violent anti-eviction mobilizations, mostly in immigrant Jewish neighborhoods. At one such battle in the Bronx, a crowd of a thousand attacked police with “fists, stones, and sticks” to forcibly halt the eviction of seventeen residents. They won not just a reversal of the evictions but a rent decrease. “The women were the most militant,” noted <em>The New York Times</em> after a similar scuffle.</p>
<p>This type of intense localized activity, amplified by a drastic housing shortage during and after World War I, forced New York state to implement rent control throughout the 1920s. For a shorter period during the war, the need to house industrial workers and service members led a number of states to enact emergency measures protecting tenants; Washington D.C. instituted rent control outright. From 1917 to 1920, 153 cities scattered throughout the country implemented forms of rent control, including places as small as <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1820528.pdf">Bath, Maine, and Sharon, Pennsylvania</a>. In some cases they passed legislation that barred rents from rising above a certain level; another method, first pioneered in New London, Connecticut, was to rely on nongovernmental “fair rent commissions” made up of labor, legal, and real estate interests, which adjudicated proposed increases or otherwise pressured landlords to keep hikes low.</p>
<p>Tenant organizing in the early twentieth century was driven as much by the strength of the broader left as by supply shortages and poor conditions. The Socialist Party invested heavily in tenant work, and labor organizers applied tactics they learned on the factory floor to their own buildings, or vice-versa (thus tenant “unions,” rent “strikes”). In 1907 Pauline Newman, a sixteen-year-old seamstress at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory (she stopped working there several years before the infamous fire), led a mostly successful rent strike that came to include ten thousand families, for which the <em>Times</em> called her the “east side Joan of Arc.” The next year Newman ran as the Socialist Party’s candidate for New York secretary of state, years before women’s suffrage became law. In 1909 the International Ladies Garment Worker Union hired her as a paid union organizer—the first woman in the nation to hold the position. Newman spent years as a close adviser to Eleanor Roosevelt and worked in labor organizing until her death at ninety-six.  </p>
<p>Throughout Newman’s life, she saw the tenant movement’s fortunes ebb and flow. In the 1930s the Depression facilitated the creation of public housing, which advocates had spent years skillfully weaving into the New Deal agenda; during the wartime housing crunch of the 1940s, President Roosevelt instituted a national rent control system that covered 80 percent of the country’s housing stock (eventually only continued by New York). At midcentury, however, the power both of the left and of labor eroded, and unions moved their social agenda, including housing, to the backburner. Membership and activity dropped, and organizations like New York’s City-Wide Tenants Council ceased to exist. The remaining, much smaller working-class tenant organizations focused their energies on immediate conditions more than on the broader political sphere, agitating around abject building conditions, evictions, and rent hikes. </p>
<p>As postwar suburbanization drained cities of wealthier residents and flipped the country to majority-homeowner, tenant organizing increased. In the 1960s organizations proliferated across blighted, de facto segregated urban neighborhoods, radical college towns, and even at the national level. Tenants won individual fights, and fair housing became a major component of the Civil Rights Act, but more often the movement lost out to the forces of disinvestment and urban renewal. In 1963 Harlem tenants organized enormous rent strikes; they won some increased enforcement against violations of maintenance requirements and an expansion of legal tools for tenants, though they fell short of achieving sweeping change. Building on the widespread energy of that effort, the civil rights leader Jesse Gray launched the National Tenant Organization, primarily composed of public housing residents. And yet with limited resources the group struggled to organize a common campaign across localities; fractured between the pursuit of militant and legalistic strategies, it fell apart in just a few years. </p>
<p>Responding to spiraling inflation, President Nixon briefly instituted national rent control—freezing rents in 1971, then capping increases until 1973—as part of a price-control scheme administered by Donald Rumsfeld. When inflation returned in 1976 tenant groups sensed an opportunity to push nationally for the policy again. The New Jersey Tenant Organization led groups from New York, Massachusetts, and Washington D.C. in creating the National Committee for Rent Control. It failed to win the measure nationally, but in the same period a range of localities adopted forms of the policy, from <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/07/archives/spread-of-rent-controls-spurs-new-controversy-rent-controls.html">Alaska to Miami Beach</a>. Later, in 1980, the NJTO led a <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.unz.com/print/InTheseTimes-1979dec19-00019/">fifty-organization</a> National Tenants Union that was overmatched by opponents before petering out.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>As renters organized, so too did real estate—and far more effectively. The National Multifamily Council formed in 1978. The National Association of Realtors <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://realtorparty.realtor/about-us/history.html">formed a PAC in 1969</a>, hired its first lobbyist in 1973, and became the <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar/history">largest trade association</a> in the country by 1975. Both groups have spent decades as extraordinarily powerful political arms for the real estate industry. In 2024 they spent <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying?cycle=All&ind=F10">$8.8 million and $86.4 million</a> on lobbying, respectively. </p>
<p>In the late twentieth century a familiar story began to play out: local tenant groups in progressive cities would win rent control schemes (thirteen localities in California, and at least five in Massachusetts and 120 in New Jersey) while national real estate groups won statewide bans. Upwards of thirty states passed laws banning cities from writing their own rent control laws, often using model legislation written by the influential conservative think tank the <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://inthesetimes.com/article/landlords-rent-control-housing-real-estate">American Legislative Exchange Council</a>. Countless tenant organizations transitioned into social service nonprofits or faltered completely, while a national bipartisan consensus formed around deregulating the housing market, destroying or defunding public housing, and transitioning low-income tenants to individual vouchers. </p>
<p>But conditions for potent tenant activity are growing once again. The national rentership rate, which had reached its lowest-ever point in 2004, spiked after the financial crisis. Nearly six million households foreclosed on their homes, which were often repurposed as rentals. In the crisis’s long aftermath, inequality skyrocketed and capital flowed back into urban cores, where wages rarely kept up with the cost of housing. One result was that downwardly-mobile millennials newer to neighborhoods increasingly mixed with working-class residents who had lived in the areas for longer; both were facing high rents and poor living conditions. </p>

<p>Energetic groups emerged that built alliances across demographics, such as LATU in California and the Crown Heights Tenant Union in Brooklyn. In previous eras of high organizing activity, tenant groups stood divided between tenement slums and the nearby neighborhoods of middle-class muckrakers, or between segregated inner cities and whiter left-wing college towns. These constituencies did sometimes collaborate—the Berkeley Tenants Union and the Black Panther Party briefly fought together for citywide rent control in the 1970s—but today’s tenant groups stand out for their relatively diverse composition.</p>
<p>Diverse groups became further entwined during the pandemic. Millions faced immediate and devastating precarity amid <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html">one of the nation’s largest-ever</a> social uprisings; they were also forced to spend vast quantities of time in their apartments. Not only were tenants from many backgrounds motivated toward radical programs like police abolition, they joined their neighbors in more immediately actionable efforts, like fixing building conditions they may have previously ignored.</p>
<p>Seemingly overnight, new tenant unions materialized across the nation, from Portland to Phoenix, Anchorage to Ithaca. Membership in existing groups surged. Many freshly radicalized organizations pushed an aggressive demand to “cancel” rent, dropping all arrears without repayment. The federal government instead launched an emergency rental assistance program, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instituted an eviction moratorium that was eventually scuttled by the Supreme Court. Some states, like New York, augmented these efforts, extending protections and supplementally funding assistance. But while the tenant movement exploded in size, it failed to secure lasting victories on a similarly large scale before the unprecedented political window closed. </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>However quickly its ranks have grown in the past five years, the movement’s overall size remains extremely limited. The labor unionization rate of the American workforce stands at 9.9 percent; if officially tallied, the formal membership rate in tenant organizations would clock in at a fraction of a percent. In cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Kansas City, membership can number in the thousands; in other cities it can be in the hundreds.</p>
<p>And yet movements can have influence far in excess of their size. Take the “Fight for $15,” a labor campaign from the 2010s in which fast food workers struck at strategically selected locations to build pressure for a federal minimum wage hike. The effort, which peaked with some 60,000 workers protesting simultaneously in two hundred cities, helped prompt such a hike in a dozen states, Washington D.C., and many major cities; secured a higher minimum wage for all Amazon workers; and resulted in an estimated <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.nelp.org/insights-research/quantifying-the-impact-of-the-fight-for-15-150-billion-in-raises-for-26-million-workers-with-76-billion-going-to-workers-of-color">$151 billion in raises for 26 million workers</a> on the whole.</p>
<p>Indeed, in recent years renters have scored some notable victories at various scales. In 2024 tenants in New York won a bill to protect millions of market-rate tenants against rent hikes. In the last decade nineteen cities, two counties, and five states have passed laws to provide free attorneys to tenants facing evictions. Organized tenants in places like Tacoma, Eugene, Fayetteville, and Ann Arbor have successfully fought to cap or end junk fees on applications, late rent and security deposits. Wherever tenants in the same building or portfolio organize, they have the potential leverage to force repairs, drive down the rent, and halt evictions. In 2020 thirty-eight families facing eviction in Minneapolis, having successfully battled their landlord for years, <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/rental-housing-crisis-minneapolis.html">finally forced him</a> to sell them the building.</p>
<p>The example of TUF is instructive. The first serious effort to organize tenants around changing federal policy since the 1980s, the group launched its campaign for national rent caps in the late summer of 2024. Organizers fanned out to ten buildings across the country. Instead of targeting a shared landlord, like most tenant campaigns, TUF concentrated instead on buildings with mortgages financed by the federal government, of which there are 12 million nationwide, supported by $150 billion of public funding a year. In a strategy reminiscent of the Fight for $15, TUF sought to leverage the upcoming presidential campaign to push not only for much-needed repairs in each building but also for the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to institute rent caps as a condition of all their financing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, out of the ten buildings, only two tenant associations in Kansas City—the only location with a deeply rooted preexisting tenant organization—were able to move to successfully strike. Theirs became the longest rent strike in the city’s history, running over <a href="https://archive.is/o/19X1a/https://kansascitydefender.com/justice/victory-over-slumlords-after-248-days-kc-tenants-wins-largest-rent-strike-in-kc-history/">eight months</a>. It won the buildings $1.35 million for emergency repairs, frozen rent for a year, caps on future rent increases, slashed late fees, and a temporary receivership for one building. And yet even where efforts to seed rent strikes failed, the tenant movement grew. When TUF attempted a strike in Ypsilanti, Michigan, even tenant association members who voted for Trump joined the fight. </p>
<p>For the time being, with Trump in the White House, it’s difficult to envision national campaigns winning any changes to federal housing policy. Perhaps that will lead to effective local campaigns—the history of organized tenants suggests that renters have more power where they are more concentrated. Yet the crises they face are still nationwide in scale, and the growing number of tenants outside of large liberal cities will continue to struggle.</p>
<p>If federal policy is out of reach for the time being, and if hyperlocal organizing on its own falls short of meeting the scale of the moment, then tenants must figure out how to split the difference. Sharing strategies and tactics can be helpful, but without a unifying campaign, efforts spread across disparate locations can too easily fall apart. Even as groups in neighborhoods, cities, and states pursue legislative campaigns relevant to their local conditions, they should also make an effort to organize large landlord portfolios spread across state lines. Locations with more members and experience can help create leverage for those in less developed areas, winning portfolio-wide rent caps like those secured by KC Tenants this year.</p>
<p>Connecting tenants across lines of class, race, and geography could also help make “tenant” a salient political identity, pushing economically precarious renters leftward. As more and more Americans find themselves excluded from the national dream of property ownership, the tenant movement must prompt renters to fight for dignity and security in tenancy rather than seeing themselves as temporarily embarrassed homeowners—a feeling that can easily curdle into resentment and political reaction. With or without intervention, individuals will struggle against escalating rents and deteriorating conditions. But it’s up to unions to give their response shape and direction. </p>
<p>After the national rent strike campaign ended, KC Tenants polled their membership to decide the organization’s trajectory for the next year. The union had previously won a citywide Tenants Bill of Rights and defeated an effort to spend billions in public funding on a new football stadium for the Chiefs. Now, according to organizers, the union voted overwhelmingly to eschew legislation in the immediate term and instead spend its energy increasing its density building by building, block by block, pledging to increase membership by the thousands. The first buildings they plan to target are owned by the Capital Realty Group—a giant national landlord with buildings in Louisville and Connecticut. They are, in effect, using this moment to build local power and national connection at once. When the next moment of political opportunity arrives, they aim to strike.</p>
<h1 id="debt-reckoning"><strong>Debt Reckoning</strong></h1>
<p>by Mary Childs</p>
<p>After the tumult of the 2008 financial crisis, the investor Bill Gross, known as “The Bond King,” was ill at ease. He’d bet on the government and against the housing market. In doing so, he made a fortune—for clients, for himself, and for the firm that he’d co-founded, which was growing into a $2 trillion behemoth. But by the spring of 2011, he had a feeling that there was a new underappreciated risk: the debt of the federal government itself.</p>
<p>The United States had borrowed billions to bail out the systemically important institutions that needed help, adding to a ballooning fiscal deficit. As Gross saw it, the government needed to raise taxes on the wealthy and cut spending on entitlements. Instead, it was issuing Treasury securities, also known as Treasuries—IOUs to buyers, including banks, asset managers, hedge funds, foreign central banks, and American citizens. But Gross thought that the value of Treasuries had been artificially inflated. His front-row vantage of the bond market was the perfect spot from which to see the way that dynamic played out: the Treasury issued the debt, and then the Federal Reserve bought it. The Fed had indicated it would stop making such substantial purchases that June. If the government wasn’t going to address the budget, Gross would vote in the market, selling his fund’s holdings of Treasuries. That was “the easiest way of staging a mini-revolution and saying ‘Hell no, we won’t go,’ ” he told <em>The Atlantic</em>. He got rid of them all, explaining the decision in his widely read newsletter, <em>Investment Outlook</em>.</p>
<p>Then, as if to underscore Gross’s logic, political infighting triggered a historic change in the standing of U.S. debt. Government borrowing levels were bumping up against the debt ceiling, and the ascendant Tea Party was demanding substantial cuts. Negotiations to raise the ceiling kept falling apart. As the summer wore on without progress, the possibility that the federal government might actually run out of money and fail to pay its obligations became increasingly real. Finally, at the eleventh hour, Congress managed to strike a deal, and President Obama signed the Budget Control Act on August 2, averting disaster.</p>
<p>But the showdown had already incurred a cost. Standard &amp; Poor’s, one of the three main agencies that determine the debt’s riskiness—a service on which investors base trillion-dollar decisions—downgraded the sovereign credit rating of the U.S. government, citing the “brinkmanship” that imperiled the government’s functioning. The United States lost its pristine AAA credit rating, owing to the demonstrated incompetence of its governance.</p>
<p>This was evidence that Gross’s bet was sound. But by the end of the year, he would apologize to his investors for how horribly wrong everything had gone—one of history’s few notable apologies for market underperformance. While the United States’ rating slid, the euro-zone debt crisis roiled through Europe, and the bad news about the American downgrade made anxious investors feel only more scared. So they did what they always did when they felt scared: they bought Treasuries. This had the dizzying effect of sparking an enormous rally in Treasuries, despite their being the very asset that had just been deemed risky. Ours was the best house in a bad neighborhood, the investors told one another—the cleanest dirty shirt, the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind.</p>
<p>I covered that downgrade as a fresh and excitable bond-market reporter at Bloomberg News. It happened on a Friday in August, when my friends and peers were pregaming on a train on the way to an overcrowded Hamptons rental. After finishing my work, I joined them the next day—and didn’t think about the flurry much in the following years. The two remaining major ratings companies, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s, still awarded the United States a AAA rating. The ten-year Treasuries issued back then have long since matured. They paid all their interest, paid back the principal, and evaporated into the ether.</p>
<p>But I’ve been thinking a lot about that moment over the past few months. Not just because I came to revisit it in my more recent writing—I wrote a book about Gross and the bond market—but because the Treasury market is again subverting expectations. In the wake of President Trump’s shocking “Liberation Day” tariff announcement in April, investors got scared, and Treasuries were supposed to rally again. But they didn’t. They fell in price, as did the U.S. dollar. Investors appeared to be running away from U.S. assets in general. Gross’s bet, in other words, was fourteen years too early.</p>
<p>Since that moment, the finance world has been strenuously debating how lasting the damage will be to the “brand” of “USA, Inc.” It isn’t just the tariffs themselves that were damaging, but the apparent attempt to “restructure” the system, one in which the dollar has been the international unit of account and our interest rates have stayed low. The degradation of trust in and independence of our institutions isn’t helping, either.</p>
<p>And then, in mid-May, Moody’s stripped the United States of its last remaining AAA credit grade (we lost our Fitch AAA in 2023). This was a rare, firm reminder that while the U.S. debt market may be exceptional, it’s not magical. Laws of financial gravity still apply. But although the Trump Administration may have thrown things into sharp relief, with confusingly calculated tariffs, a disorderly attempt to reshape the world order, and stark ideological pivots, the fundamental trustworthiness of the United States and our debt was fraying well before his first term. And the supposedly safest and largest bond market, on which the entire global financial system rests, has been cracking for years.</p>
<p>The debt of the U.S. government has a special, almost holy place in global finance. Its primacy is based on decades of trust in institutions; in adequate but not excessive regulation that maintains an orderly and predictable market; in a transparent and independent judiciary; in rich citizens who pay their taxes. The U.S. government has never materially defaulted. Because of that trust, and the surprisingly durable largesse of the American consumer, the market for Treasuries has become the biggest and most liquid sovereign-debt market in the world, in which hundreds of billions of dollars trade every day. This has a virtuous-circle effect: because Treasuries are so easy to buy and sell, and the market is so big that investors can trade enormous blocks of debt without it reacting much, people feel all the more confident in the asset. Treasuries are as good as cash. And as a borrower, the United States has been seen as risk-free. That confidence itself confers a benefit, in which rates are fantastically low for “risk-free” borrowers like us. On trillions of debt, those savings quickly become real money.</p>
<p>We have enjoyed these benefits for a while now. Even though the excesses that led to the Great Recession originated in our financial system, U.S. government debt has consistently rallied in the resultant chaos, as it did in 2011. We’ve capitalized on the special status of Treasuries in two ways. First, policymakers seeking to make banks safer wrote new rules, including requirements that those banks hold “high-quality liquid assets,” typically in the form of Treasuries. The second is that the federal government issued as much debt as it could, waiting for the bond market to tell it to stop. The ratio of U.S. government debt to our GDP—a metric economists use to gauge a country’s economic health—rose from 63 percent in 2007 to 104 percent ten years later. (It would reach 121 percent in 2022.) Traditional economics dictates that a government with a growing deficit will at some point have to pay more in interest to borrow. But the yields on Treasuries generally fell during this period—seeming to indicate increased investor comfort, and less and less risk. It looked as though investors did not care about debt or the deficit, and worrying about those numbers was maybe a cute hobby, something to undertake only if you enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Theories about this stability flourished. Economists from all points on the political spectrum examined datasets and methodologies to try to understand it. Were we missing something? Were we looking at the wrong picture, a result of our old tools’ failure to capture changes in the labor market that kept productivity high, wages low, and inflation down? Was the internet’s new competitive transparency helping to lower prices? If workers didn’t think inflation was coming, maybe they didn’t negotiate for higher wages, which meant that companies didn’t increase prices to account for them.</p>
<p>Another explanation cited a structural force that’s proved surprisingly durable: the American consumer’s seemingly endless demand for relatively cheap goods from abroad. That addiction meant that we would send dollars all around the world, and those who received them could swap the cash for Treasuries for the benefit of interest payments. That demand for Treasuries would persist for as long as Americans bought more toys made in other countries than we made domestically. So, forever.</p>
<p>This global imbalance is what factions of the Trump Administration have now objected to, as evidenced by the work of Stephen Miran, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and in the tea leaves of the initial Liberation Day tariffs. It’s also key to a theory that began to gain traction about a decade ago on the opposite side of the political spectrum: that to fret about the deficit is to misdiagnose the problem, that the main thing to watch out for is inflation. This school of thought—shepherded most notably by Stephanie Kelton, a former chief economist on the Senate Budget Committee for the Democrats and adviser to Bernie Sanders—says that the real constraint on government spending is the economy’s capacity on the supply side of the equation. The rise of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), as this perspective is called, horrified many traditional economists, but every year that government borrowing grew and rates stayed low, MMT seemed more and more compelling. And it wasn’t just MMT’s adherents who began floating these ideas. As the mainstream economist Olivier Blanchard put it in 2019: “Public debt may have no fiscal cost.”</p>
<p>For years, inflation kept not arriving. It was the great mystery of the post-crash world.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the mystery persisted. Our government was able to refinance our debt and issue more at wildly low rates that felt unimaginable until the market produced them. Two percent on the ten-year Treasury, in 2011? Bond buyers balked, and then they kept buying. How much lower could it go? A lot, it turned out; that yield would reach 0.52 percent in August 2020.</p>
<p>Close watchers of the Treasury system were already fretting. In 2021, Yesha Yadav, of Vanderbilt Law School, identified structural fragilities in the market, caused by simple cavalier inattention: Why bother scrutinizing the safest thing out there? She pointed out just how fragmented oversight of the market is; whereas the Securities and Exchange Commission oversees stocks and corporate bonds, “Treasuries are supervised by five or more major agencies, none of which has lead status,” she wrote in a 2021 paper, which in turn results in no one regulating the market effectively. The rule book for Treasuries was worryingly “sparse,” Yadav wrote—so much so that regulators themselves are not quite sure what is enforceable when.</p>
<p>Newer quirks have vexed Jeffrey Meli, now a clinical professor of finance at NYU’s Stern School of Business, who left the banking group Barclays after twenty years to study how reforms have distributed risk across the financial system. Back when I reported on the bond market, I read Meli’s work all the time, and I decided to call him up this past April. Meli looks at the way new regulations have both constrained how much risk financial institutions can take as well as defined how much firms hold, no matter how risky that holding—and institutions have had to maintain a tolerable amount of liquid assets to cover deposit outflows. These mandated high-quality assets ended up being de facto Treasuries. The system begins to fold in on itself. Once one person has promised a Treasury as collateral, they hand over that Treasury to their trading counterparty, who then needs collateral of their own. The latter party often lends it out, too—that same Treasury. Manmohan Singh, a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund, estimated in a <em>Financial Times</em> article that, in 2021, high-quality liquid collateral—including Treasuries—was reused approximately two times. According to a 2020 paper by researchers at the Fed, the big banks may be using each Treasury up to seven times.</p>
<p>This is the paradox where Meli gets stuck. The financial system is much safer now because all parties use the safest-possible collateral. But how safe can such a collective dependency be? If everyone has promised their Treasuries away, and Treasury prices fall, then everyone suddenly needs more. This could spark a spiral, the kind we maybe saw glimpses of after Liberation Day and that seems, at best, difficult and expensive to stop. “We’ve rebuilt our entire financial system’s regulatory environment after the financial crisis, and a fundamental linchpin in that whole system is that the Treasury market functions well,” Meli told me. “If it doesn’t function well, this system that we built is on a house of cards.”</p>
<p>One of the most significant results of the post-crisis reforms is a phenomenon that’s been giving regulators and policy experts headaches, known as “the basis trade.” In the ruins of the housing crash, we discovered we had accidentally shoved a bunch of risk-taking into a system of “shadow banks”—a term coined by Paul McCulley, a friend and colleague of Gross’s, who described an interconnected web of financial entities that were not banks but that acted like them, lending and borrowing out of sight of regulators. Banks have direct access to the Fed’s discount window, where they can get funding if they find themselves in a pinch; shadow banks do not. We’ve since subjected shadow banks to a bit more regulatory light, but not as much as the banks themselves, which are far less risky these days. And with more constraints on banks, simply holding low-yield U.S. government debt wasn’t profitable enough.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the market, big asset managers now want to buy futures contracts, or derivative bets on Treasuries that have the look and feel of a Treasury without necessarily requiring all that cash. For them to do this, someone takes the opposite side of that contract. And hedge funds—part of that shadow system—are happy to help. It’s a little act of arbitrage, in which the hedge funds act as janitors for the financial markets, mopping up the messiness and pushing the markets closer to perfect, sparkling efficiency. To make it adequately lucrative, they scale up by borrowing a lot.</p>
<p>This is a basis trade: a trader captures the difference between a derivative contract and the actual thing it refers to. By 2020, this particular Treasuries trade by hedge funds became known as <em>the</em> basis trade, because it uses the most neutral, benchmark asset in the world, and because it has gotten so big. There’s now an estimated $800 billion in the basis trade, according to the investment firm Apollo. But hedge funds are fickle, with no obligation to hold Treasuries in a storm. They will sell whenever they want. They also do not have access to any of the Fed’s remedies in the event of a panic—much as the investment banks did not until they became “bank holding companies” in 2008 to get to use the Fed’s myriad tools.</p>
<p>Where we once had shadow banks, we now also have “shadow dealers,” entities that again evade the vision of regulators, but that are suddenly load-bearing parts of the structure of the entire financial world. Should hedge funds decide all at once to sell their Treasuries, the markets would break. At least that’s what investors, policymakers, and regulators fear. (A recent Brookings paper advised that the Fed “be prepared to bail out hedge funds’ positions.”)</p>
<p>It’s of course not just hedge funds that hold boatloads of Treasuries. So do foreign central banks, pension funds, and many other investors. But this trade is exemplary of what Meli calls the “trilemma” that policymakers now face. We can have stable banks and stable markets, or we can have people taking real risks in financial markets without the explicit or implicit promise that they will get bailed out if they run into too much trouble. But we can’t have all three.</p>
<p>The trilemma was never clearer than during the pandemic. In the panic of March 2020, the basis trade exploded, and the Fed stepped in to stabilize the malfunctioning Treasury market. This time around, politicians worried about not spending enough and slogging through a slow, painful recovery—as in 2008’s aftermath—so they moved quickly to inject trillions of dollars into the economy, and a wave of newly issued Treasuries followed. The government kept issuing more debt, and the bond market kept yawning.</p>
<p>Back then, people like Yadav and Meli were among a handful of outliers; fretting was uncool, or cool only in certain Republican circles. But the circular logic was becoming too pronounced to overlook. It was also bothering Hanno Lustig, a professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. He and some of his colleagues started looking into whether the market was still sensitive to fiscal shocks, in which deficit-increasing announcements provoke some kind of financial reaction. Their research found that, in the short term, the market did care. The longer-term yawning was simply smoothing it out.</p>
<p>Lustig’s team put forward a theory that the market had an ouroboros problem: The Fed was an enormous buyer of U.S. government debt, as were its peer central banks around the world. All that buying necessarily drives up prices, and drives yields lower. Bill Gross had clocked this phenomenon in 2011—he just hadn’t realized how long his fellow bond buyers would tolerate it.</p>
<p>Here, Lustig hypothesizes, neoclassical economic training may be part of the obstacle. That school of thought uses models in which central bankers can’t control long-term real rates, but the market evidence Lustig witnessed suggests that policymakers had their thumb on the scale in Treasury markets. “It’s never a good idea to use something as a source of information, but also to manipulate it,” he told me.</p>
<p>Whatever was muting the responsiveness in markets started to end after the pandemic. Treasury yields rose and inflation finally showed up. Maybe we overshot the market’s upper limit on unfunded federal borrowing. It would be nice to know what that limit is; in the decades since the Bretton Woods agreement, which made the dollar the world’s primary reserve and trading currency, our role in the global economic structure has grown even more central. That position only heightens the paradox at the heart of the Treasury market: in order for the market to function well, it needs to be big—really big. It’s the opposite of normal laws of supply and demand. More was good, actually—to a point. But that point was unknown and all too easy to ignore. And, Lustig says, politicians were happy to oblige.</p>
<p>“What’s bizarre is that, even though in economics we spend a lot of time thinking about incentives, when we think about macro policies like monetary policy, we don’t really do that,” Lustig told me. “Any politician who’s good at his job is going to see these bond yields and think, Boy, we’ve got tons of fiscal capacity.” They responded naturally, he said, “by running huge deficits.”</p>
<p>Lustig presented his work last August at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, which is put on every year by the Kansas City Fed. For more than forty years, central bankers, policymakers, and academics have flown in to chat in a charming lodge with white-capped mountains in the background, and discuss the latest research under a theme determined to be among the most salient economic issues of the day. In 2024, that was “reassessing the effectiveness and transmission of monetary policy,” which is to say: the Fed’s tools don’t seem to be affecting markets the way they’re supposed to.</p>
<p>The research Lustig presented focused on the Treasury market in March 2020—a snapshot, he says, of the moment when, after the U.S. government announced all that spending and foreign buyers starting selling their holdings, markets began waking up to the volume of government debt.</p>
<p>Lustig says his talk didn’t go over too well; the central bankers, who can’t control federal spending, “thought it was a bit unfair.” But he thinks these institutions need to update the way they’re looking at the world; they think we live in one where Treasuries are safe, and he doesn’t believe it. “Interestingly, if I could give the same talk this year, I think it’d go over much better,” he said.</p>
<p>In the past, I brushed off fretting about fiscal capacity as an ideologically driven pastime, something people who wanted small government would engage in no matter the empirical reality. I take it somewhat more seriously now. At first, I thought that was just a natural part of the aging process—skin laxity, a sudden interest in World War II history, and a creeping sense of dread about the debt. But then I took a fresh look at how much we’ve borrowed. It’s now $36 trillion, $29 trillion of it sold publicly (about $7 trillion is owed by the government to the government). The Trump Administration is projected to add trillions more. When economists build models to forecast reality, they often include a “No Ponzi” condition, meaning government borrowing will not grow faster than the economy indefinitely. Generally one wants reality, too, not to violate that condition; on our current trajectory, it will. It also matters what the debt is being used for. Is it for something productive or unproductive? For investment in industries and productivity and flourishing that might yield something down the road, or for immediately gratifying consumption? Paying interest you already promised doesn’t generate any new return (though we should still do it).</p>
<p>Of course, our national debt remains a politicized issue; people embed their ideological aims in their urgent warnings about Treasuries and interest rates. The Harvard professor Kenneth Rogoff told me that “progressives have had their head in the sand about the deficit,” partly because they’re bad at admitting there are trade-offs; he published a paper in the August 2024 issue of the <em>American Economic Review</em> showing that long-term real rates tend to move back to a historical equilibrium. “It was like saying climate change might have partly natural causes,” he said. He watched his thesis get mangled as it moved through the ideology machine. “People think, Well, you’re in favor of ‘austerity’ because you think there’s a trade-off.”</p>
<p>If only we could talk about it in good faith. The chaos sown by the Trump Administration’s tax proposals (nominally to stimulate growth) and its tariffs and policies (purportedly in service of bringing back U.S. manufacturing, which would imply a desire for a weaker dollar) has given progressives the capacity to consider the idea that there might be trouble in the market for U.S. debt. But now we face an international reevaluation of our trustworthiness—and of the entire post–World War II economic system. We have many suggestions of how to mitigate these disparate risks: we could relax bank regulations that don’t weight for risk; regulate hedge-fund leverage; create bailout facilities for basis-trading hedge funds; cut spending; borrow less; raise taxes; mature beyond a debt-ceiling tug-of-war; recommit to the rule of law—anything that might acknowledge those old laws of gravity. But such an acknowledgment seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Like many who have been trying to raise the alarm, Lustig wasn’t born in the United States. He’s from Belgium, which had a full-scale fiscal crisis in the Eighties. “I’m old enough to remember that,” he told me, “and to remember that it was unpleasant.” But in the United States, we’ve never had one. Most of us can’t even imagine that this ignorance is a privilege we could lose.</p>
<p>Lustig fears we are in for “full-fledged financial repression,” in which the Fed absorbs an enormous fraction of the government debt and keeps rates low. He sees this as already happening in the euro zone. It’s not a pretty picture, he says: Low rates hurt the poor more than the rich. Asset prices go up, which is great if you already own them and largely irrelevant if you have only a little money in savings. Low rates mean better terms on a new mortgage, but higher listing prices. Financial repression would amount to the government’s “pick[ing] the pockets of savers,” as Bill Gross put it back in 2011. For now, some hope remains in the fact that the U.S. economy is still growing, in the idea that perhaps we can somehow grow fast enough to outrun our debt—that old American exceptionalism.</p>

<h1 id="lovesick"><strong>Lovesick</strong></h1>
<p>by Janet Malcolm, 5/8/2021</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a box in my apartment labeled “Old Not Good Photos.” This is an understatement. Most of the photos are two-and-a-half-inch squares, showing little blurred black-and-white images, taken from too far away of people whose features you can barely make out, standing or sitting alone or in groups, against backgrounds of gray uninterestingness. They are like the barely flickering dreams that dissipate as we awaken, rather than the self-important ones that follow us into the day and seem to be crying out for interpretation. However, as psychoanalysis has taught us, it is the least prepossessing dreams, disguised as such to put us off the scent, that sometimes bear the most important messages from inner life. So too, some of the drab little photographs, if stared at long enough, begin to speak to us.</p>
<p>A picture of seventeen high school boys and girls, sitting on the grass and mugging at the camera, takes me to a deep blue sky punctuated by the silhouettes of minarets. I have never been to the Middle East. The memory of the minaret-studded sky comes from a movie house called Loew’s 72nd Street, where I saw many movies in my childhood and youth and where one of the boys in the picture, Jimmy Scovotti, worked as an usher on weekends. Before the house darkened and the movie came on, one sat in a kind of Orientalist dream. The interior had been done up as an Arabian Nights palace. I don’t remember being especially thrilled by it—Loew’s 72nd Street was not the only movie house where this sort of entertainment was added to the celluloid entertainment—but I enjoyed it as I enjoyed the other now preposterous-seeming amenities of the 1940s. It was my first encounter with the clichés that Edward Said’s great book held up to view.</p>
<p>I don’t recognize any other boy in the photograph. I only recognize a girl named Natalie Gudkov and myself. I know the picture was taken at an outing to a place in Yonkers called Tibbetts Brook Park, but I remember nothing about the outing itself, or why I was there. I know these were kids I did not have much to do with in high school. None of the boys were the ones I was in love with during those years. As I write the words “in love,” the picture—I was about to say dream—begins to speak, a bit too fast, about the habit of love we form in childhood, the virus of lovesickness that lodges itself within us, for which there is no vaccine. We never rid ourselves of the disease. We move in and out of states of chronic longing. When we look at our lives and notice what we are consistently, helplessly gripped by, what else can we say but “me too”?</p>
<p>In “Observations on Transference-Love” (1915), the third in a series of papers on analytic technique that formed a sort of operating manual for analysts in the early days of the profession, Sigmund Freud alerted new practitioners (none of whom were women) to one of its occupational hazards. Women patients, he warned, are going to fall in love with you, but don’t think that this is “to be attributed to the charms of [your] own person” or that it is real love. It is a peculiarity of the treatment, a form of resistance to it. Whatever you do, don’t reciprocate, but see what you can do about persuading the patient to stick out her lovesickness and remain in the analysis, which will eventually cure her of the problems with love that brought her to it in the first place. The analyst</p>
<p>“must take care not to steer away from the transference-love, or to repulse it or to make it distasteful to the patient; but he must just as resolutely withhold any response to it. He must keep firm hold of the transference-love, but treat it as something unreal, as a situation which has to be gone through in the treatment and traced back to its unconscious origins and which must assist in bringing all that is most deeply hidden in the patient’s erotic life into her consciousness and therefore under her control.”</p>
<p>Freud goes on to spell out the difference between transference-love and “genuine love.” He argues that if the patient were truly in love with the analyst, she would try to help him with the treatment rather than to sabotage it. And “as a second argument against the genuineness of this love we advance the fact that it exhibits not a single new feature arising from the present situation, but is entirely composed of repetitions and copies of earlier reactions, including infantile ones.”</p>
<p>Then Freud makes one of the sly rhetorical turns by which his work is marked and that give it its special potency. He anticipates the reader’s objection to what he is saying by agreeing with it: “Can we truly say that the state of being in love which becomes manifest in analytic treatment is not a real one?” No, we can’t. “It is true that the love consists of new editions of old traits and that it repeats infantile reactions. But this is the essential character of every state of being in love.” He goes on:</p>
<p>“Transference-love has perhaps a degree less of freedom than the love that appears in ordinary life and is called normal; it displays its dependence on the infantile pattern more clearly and is less adaptable and capable of modification; but that is all, and <em>not what is essential</em>.” [italics mine]</p>
<p>Freud ends the paper by returning to his admonitions. Yes,</p>
<p>“sexual love is undoubtedly one of the chief things in life, and the union of mental and bodily satisfaction in the enjoyment of love is one of its culminating peaks. Apart from a few queer fanatics, all the world knows this and conducts its life accordingly.”</p>
<p>But the analyst must stand firm against the temptation to return the patient’s love. He adds:</p>
<p>“It is not a patient’s crudely sensual desires which constitute the temptation…. It is rather, perhaps, a woman’s subtler and aim-inhibited wishes which bring with them the danger of making a man forget his technique and his medical task for the sake of a fine experience.”</p>
<p><em>A fine experience</em>. If we read “Observations on Transference-Love” with the evenly hovering attention with which the analyst is taught to listen to the patient’s monologues, we are struck with the language that Freud allows into his scientific paper, the language of ordinary life lived in pursuit of erotic experience. It is Freud’s honesty that rises above his ambitions as a scientist and forces him to acknowledge that this thing called transference-love is a pretty wobbly notion, if not a cover-up for the attraction that develops between a man and a woman who meet every day in a small room and talk about intimate things while one of them is lying down. The concept of transference, the idea that we never see each other as we “are” but always through a haze of associations with early family figures, is the matrix of psychoanalytic therapy. The analyst draws the patient’s attention to what he doesn’t notice in regular life, to the stale old drama he feels compelled to play out with every new person. He proposes an alternative script to this comedy of misprision. But Freud acknowledges—and never with more rueful force than in “Observations on Transference-Love”—the enduring injuries of our hapless earliest erotic encounters.</p>
<p>At the time of the Tibbetts Brook Park outing, I had, of course, not read Freud’s paper, and would not read it for many years. But another text on abstinent love was well known to me: a best-selling novel called <em>Seventeenth Summer</em> by Maureen Daly, first published in 1942, that chronicled the summer romance of a seventeen-year-old girl named Angie Morrow and a boy of the same age named Jack Duluth who lived in the Wisconsin town of Fond du Lac and never did anything more than kiss. Rereading the book years later, I recognized it for what it was—a tract for the repressive sexual ideology of the time, whereby nice girls didn’t “go all the way” and nice boys hardly expected or wanted them to, given their own nervous-making sexual inexperience. But in its day, the book only encouraged underinformed teenaged girls like myself in our longings for sexless romance, and never disturbed the curtain of humorlessness through which so much of postwar American reality was filtered. When Angie recalled her first date with Jack on a boat—“I remember thinking when he was so close how much he smelled like Ivory soap”—we did not laugh. How else should a boy worthy of love smell?</p>
<p>The metaphors of cleanness vs. dirtiness form the book’s understructure, instantiate its opposition of purity vs. corruption. Whenever Jack appears, Angie, who is no slob herself—she is always ironing or changing sheets or drying dishes—immediately and happily notices how much cleaner he is than any other boy. (“His shirts always seemed clean when other fellows’ were warm and wrinkled.”) The dirty act of sex is represented by nature, by the dark, muddy water and slimy weeds of the lake and trees,</p>
<p>“bent low, twisting and moaning, wrenching at their trunks and writhing in a strange sympathy with the tormented water. Gray waves rolled crashing toward the shore and thrashed against the wooden pier, slapping like bare hands against the flat rocks. High sprays of foam tossed into the air and the wind was heavy with the damp, suggestive smell of fish.”</p>
<p>Lest the reader allow the suggestiveness of the nature passages to lead her, even just in thought, from the sex-fearing straight and narrow, Daly introduces a cautionary subplot involving Lorraine, Angie’s sister, who isn’t beautiful and natural the way Angie is—she is always putting her hair in curlers and covering her face with cold cream—and who, in her desperation to keep him interested in her, succumbs to the demands for sex of a “fast,” unpleasant, older (in his twenties) guy named Martin. We never learn whether the ill-favored Lorraine went all the way with Martin, or just allowed him the liberties then known as “petting” or “heavy petting.” “Things are different now from the way they used to be,” Lorraine defiantly says to Angie during the confessional scene in which we learn of her transgressions. “Now <em>everybody</em> does it and nobody thinks…you know what I mean…” But later she piteously admits, “This isn’t how I meant to grow up. I’ve heard of other girls…but that isn’t how I meant to be.”</p>
<p>Daly’s tale of careful love is still in print. Among the responses to the book on Amazon, my favorite is from a reader in her twenties who just bought a copy for an eleven-year-old and isn’t sure how the gift will be received. “For an 11 year old girl that daydreams about kissing boys, she’d probably like it. For an 11-year-old girl that’s already had sex, the book may seem ‘lame.’”</p>
<h1 id="love-amor"><strong>Love (“Amor”)</strong></h1>
<p>By Clarice Lispector, translated by Katrina Dodson</p>
<hr>
<p>A little tired, the groceries stretching out her new knit sack, Ana boarded the tram. She placed the bundle in her lap and the tram began to move. She then settled back in her seat trying to get comfortable, with a half-contented sigh.</p>
<p>Ana’s children were good, something true and succulent. They were growing up, taking their baths, demanding for themselves, misbehaved, ever more complete moments. The kitchen was after all spacious, the faulty stove gave off small explosions. The heat was stifling in the apartment they were paying off bit by bit. But the wind whipping the curtains she herself had cut to measure reminded her that if she wanted she could stop and wipe her brow, gazing at the calm horizon. Like a farmhand. She had sown the seeds she had in her hand, no others, but these alone. And trees were growing. Her brief conversation with the electric bill collector was growing, the water in the laundry sink was growing, her children were growing, the table with food was growing, her husband coming home with the newspapers and smiling with hunger, the tiresome singing of the maids in the building. Ana gave to everything, tranquilly, her small, strong hand, her stream of life.</p>
<p>A certain hour of the afternoon was more dangerous. A certain hour of the afternoon the trees she had planted would laugh at her. When nothing else needed her strength, she got worried. Yet she felt more solid than ever, her body had filled out a bit and it was a sight to see her cut the fabric for the boys’ shirts, the large scissors snapping on the cloth. All her vaguely artistic desire had long since been directed toward making the days fulfilled and beautiful; over time, her taste for the decorative had developed and supplanted her inner disorder. She seemed to have discovered that everything could be perfected, to each thing she could lend a harmonious appearance; life could be wrought by the hand of man.</p>
<p>Deep down, Ana had always needed to feel the firm root of things. And this is what a home bewilderingly had given her. Through winding paths, she had fallen into a woman’s fate, with the surprise of fitting into it as if she had invented it. The man she’d married was a real man, the children she’d had were real children. Her former youth seemed as strange to her as one of life’s illnesses. She had gradually emerged from it to discover that one could also live without happiness: abolishing it, she had found a legion of people, previously invisible, who lived the way a person works — with persistence, continuity, joy. What had happened to Ana before she had a home was forever out of reach: a restless exaltation so often mistaken for unbearable happiness. In exchange she had created something at last comprehensible, an adult life. That was what she had wanted and chosen.</p>
<p>The only thing she worried about was being careful during that dangerous hour of the afternoon, when the house was empty and needed nothing more from her, the sun high, the family members scattered to their duties. As she looked at the clean furniture, her heart would contract slightly in astonishment. But there was no room in her life for feeling tender toward her astonishment — she’d smother it with the same skill the household chores had given her. Then she’d go do the shopping or get something repaired, caring for her home and family in their absence. When she returned it would be the end of the afternoon and the children home from school needed her. In this way night would fall, with its peaceful vibration. In the morning she’d awake haloed by her calm duties. She’d find the furniture dusty and dirty again, as if repentantly come home. As for herself, she obscurely participated in the gentle black roots of the world. And nourished life anonymously. That was what she had wanted and chosen.</p>
<p>The tram went swaying along the tracks, heading down broad avenues. Soon a more humid breeze blew announcing, more than the end of the afternoon, the end of the unstable hour. Ana breathed deeply and a great acceptance gave her face a womanly air.</p>
<p>The tram would slow, then come to a halt. There was time to relax before Humaitá. That was when she looked at the man standing at the tram stop.</p>
<p>The difference between him and the others was that he really was stopped. Standing there, his hands reaching in front of him. He was blind.</p>
<p>What else could have made Ana sit up warily? Something uneasy was happening. Then she saw: the blind man was chewing gum … A blind man was chewing gum.</p>
<p>Ana still had a second to think about how her brothers were coming for dinner — her heart beat violently, at intervals. Leaning forward, she stared intently at the blind man, the way we stare at things that don’t see us. He was chewing gum in the dark. Without suffering, eyes open. The chewing motion made it look like he was smiling and then suddenly not smiling, smiling and not smiling — as if he had insulted her, Ana stared at him. And whoever saw her would have the impression of a woman filled with hatred. But she kept staring at him, leaning further and further forward — the tram suddenly lurched throwing her unexpectedly backward, the heavy knit sack tumbled from her lap, crashed to the floor — Ana screamed, the conductor gave the order to stop before he knew what was happening — the tram ground to a halt, the passengers looked around frightened.</p>
<p>Unable to move to pick up her groceries, Ana sat up, pale. A facial expression, long unused, had reemerged with difficulty, still tentative, incomprehensible. The paperboy laughed while returning her bundle. But the eggs had broken inside their newspaper wrapping. Viscous, yellow yolks dripped through the mesh. The blind man had interrupted his chewing and was reaching out his uncertain hands, trying in vain to grasp what was happening. The package of eggs had been thrown from the bag and, amid the passengers’ smiles and the conductor’s signal, the tram lurched back into motion.</p>
<p>A few seconds later nobody was looking at her. The tram rumbled along the tracks and the blind man chewing gum stayed behind forever. But the damage was done.</p>
<p>The knit mesh was rough between her fingers, not intimate as when she had knit it. The mesh had lost its meaning and being on a tram was a snapped thread; she didn’t know what to do with the groceries on her lap. And like a strange song, the world started up again all around. The damage was done. Why? could she have forgotten there were blind people? Compassion was suffocating her, Ana breathed heavily. Even the things that existed before this event were now wary, had a more hostile, perishable aspect … The world had become once again a distress. Several years were crashing down, the yellow yolks were running. Expelled from her own days, it seemed to her that the people on the street were in peril, kept afloat on the surface of the darkness by a minimal balance — and for a moment the lack of meaning left them so free they didn’t know where to go. The perception of an absence of law happened so suddenly that Ana clutched the seat in front of her, as if she might fall off the tram, as if things could be reverted with the same calm they no longer held.</p>
<p>What she called a crisis had finally come. And its sign was the intense pleasure with which she now looked at things, suffering in alarm. The heat had become more stifling, everything had gained strength and louder voices. On the Rua Voluntários da Pátria a revolution seemed about to break out, the sewer grates were dry, the air dusty. A blind man chewing gum had plunged the world into dark voraciousness. In every strong person there was an absence of compassion for the blind man and people frightened her with the vigor they possessed. Next to her was a lady in blue, with a face. She averted her gaze, quickly. On the sidewalk, a woman shoved her son! Two lovers interlaced their fingers smiling … And the blind man? Ana had fallen into an excruciating benevolence.</p>
<p>She had pacified life so well, taken such care for it not to explode. She had kept it all in serene comprehension, separated each person from the rest, clothes were clearly made to be worn and you could choose the evening movie from the newspaper — everything wrought in such a way that one day followed another. And a blind man chewing gum was shattering it all to pieces. And through this compassion there appeared to Ana a life full of sweet nausea, rising to her mouth.</p>
<p>Only then did she realize she was long past her stop. In her weak state everything was hitting her with a jolt; she left the tram weak in the knees, looked around, clutching the eggstained mesh. For a moment she couldn’t get her bearings. She seemed to have stepped off into the middle of the night.</p>
<p>It was a long street, with high, yellow walls. Her heart pounding with fear, she sought in vain to recognize her surroundings, while the life she had discovered kept pulsating and a warmer, more mysterious wind whirled round her face. She stood there looking at the wall. At last she figured out where she was. Walking a little further along a hedge, she passed through the gates of the Botanical Garden.</p>
<p>She trudged down the central promenade, between the coconut palms. There was no one in the Garden. She put her packages on the ground, sat on a bench along a path and stayed there a long while.</p>
<p>The vastness seemed to calm her, the silence regulated her breathing. She was falling asleep inside herself.</p>
<p>From a distance she saw the avenue of palms where the afternoon was bright and full. But the shade of the branches covered the path.</p>
<p>All around were serene noises, scent of trees, little surprises among the vines. The whole Garden crushed by the ever faster instants of the afternoon. From where did that half-dream come that encircled her? Like a droning of bees and birds. Everything was strange, too gentle, too big.</p>
<p>A light, intimate movement startled her — she spun around. Nothing seemed to have moved. But motionless in the central avenue stood a powerful cat. Its fur was soft. Resuming its silent walk, it disappeared.</p>
<p>Worried, she looked around. The branches were swaying, the shadows wavering on the ground. A sparrow was pecking at the dirt. And suddenly, in distress, she seemed to have fallen into an ambush. There was a secret labor underway in the Garden that she was starting to perceive.</p>
<p>In the trees the fruits were black, sweet like honey. On the ground were dried pits full of circumvolutions, like little rotting brains. The bench was stained with purple juices. With intense gentleness the waters murmured. Clinging to the tree trunk were the luxuriant limbs of a spider. The cruelty of the world was tranquil. The murder was deep. And death was not what we thought.</p>
<p>While imaginary — it was a world to sink one’s teeth into, a world of voluminous dahlias and tulips. The trunks were crisscrossed by leafy parasites, their embrace was soft, sticky. Like the revulsion that precedes a surrender — it was fascinating, the woman was nauseated, and it was fascinating.</p>
<p>The trees were laden, the world was so rich it was rotting. When Ana thought how there were children and grown men going hungry, the nausea rose to her throat, as if she were pregnant and abandoned. The moral of the Garden was something else. Now that the blind man had led her to it, she trembled upon the first steps of a sparkling, shadowy world, where giant water lilies floated monstrous. The little flowers scattered through the grass didn’t look yellow or rosy to her, but the color of bad gold and scarlet. The decomposition was deep, perfumed … But all the heavy things, she saw with her head encircled by a swarm of insects, sent by the most exquisite life in the world. The breeze insinuated itself among the flowers. Ana sensed rather than smelled its sweetish scent … The Garden was so pretty that she was afraid of Hell.</p>
<p>It was nearly evening now and everything seemed full, heavy, a squirrel leaped in the shadows. Beneath her feet the earth was soft, Ana inhaled it with delight. It was fascinating, and she felt nauseated.</p>
<p>But when she remembered the children, toward whom she was now guilty, she stood with a cry of pain. She grabbed her bag, went down the dark path, reached the promenade. She was nearly running — and she saw the Garden all around, with its haughty impersonality. She rattled the locked gates, rattled them gripping the rough wood. The guard appeared, shocked not to have seen her.</p>
<p>Until she reached the door of her building, she seemed on the verge of a disaster. She ran to the elevator clutching the mesh sack, her soul pounding in her chest — what was happening? Her compassion for the blind man was as violent as an agony, but the world seemed to be hers, dirty, perishable, hers. She opened her front door. The living room was large, square, the doorknobs were gleaming spotlessly, the windowpanes gleaming, the lamp gleaming — what new land was this? And for an instant the wholesome life she had led up till now seemed like a morally insane way to live. The boy who ran to her was a being with long legs and a face just like hers, who ran up and hugged her. She clutched him tightly, in alarm. She protected herself trembling. Because life was in peril. She loved the world, loved what had been created — she loved with nausea. The same way she’d always been fascinated by oysters, with that vaguely sick feeling she always got when nearing the truth, warning her. She embraced her son, nearly to the point of hurting him. As if she had learned of an evil — the blind man or the lovely Botanical Garden? — she clung to him, whom she loved more than anything. She had been touched by the demon of faith. Life is horrible, she said to him softly, ravenous. What would she do if she heeded the call of the blind man? She would go alone … There were places poor and rich that needed her. She needed them … I’m scared, she said. She felt the child’s delicate ribs between her arms, heard his frightened sobbing. Mama, the boy called. She held him away from her, looked at that face, her heart cringed. Don’t let Mama forget you, she told him. As soon as the child felt her embrace loosen, he broke free and fled to the bedroom door, looking at her from greater safety. It was the worst look she had ever received. The blood rushed to her face, warming it.</p>
<p>She let herself fall into a chair, her fingers still gripping the mesh sack. What was she ashamed of?</p>
<p>There was no escape. The days she had forged had ruptured the crust and the water was pouring out. She was facing the oyster. And there was no way not to look at it. What was she ashamed of? That it was no longer compassion, it wasn’t just compassion: her heart had filled with the worst desire to live.</p>
<p>She no longer knew whether she was on the side of the blind man or the dense plants. The man had gradually receded into the distance and in torture she seemed to have gone over to the side of whoever had wounded his eyes. The Botanical Garden, tranquil and tall, was revealing this to her. In horror she was discovering that she belonged to the strong part of the world — and what name should she give her violent mercy? She would have to kiss the leper, since she would never be just his sister. A blind man led me to the worst in myself, she thought in alarm. She felt banished because no pauper would drink water from her ardent hands. Ah! it was easier to be a saint than a person! By God, hadn’t it been real, the compassion that had fathomed the deepest waters of her heart? But it was the compassion of a lion.</p>
<p>Humiliated, she knew the blind man would prefer a poorer love. And, trembling, she also knew why. The life of the Botanical Garden was calling her as a werewolf is called by the moonlight. Oh! but she loved the blind man! she thought with moist eyes. Yet this wasn’t the feeling you’d go to church with. I’m scared, she said alone in the living room. She got up and went to the kitchen to help the maid with dinner.</p>
<p>But life made her shiver, like a chill. She heard the school bell, distant and constant. The little horror of the dust threading together the underside of the oven, where she discovered the little spider. Carrying the vase to change its water — there was the horror of the flower surrendering languid and sickening to her hands. The same secret labor was underway there in the kitchen. Near the trash can, she crushed the ant with her foot. The little murder of the ant. The tiny body trembled. The water droplets were dripping into the stagnant water in the laundry sink. The summer beetles. The horror of the inexpressive beetles. All around was a silent, slow, persistent life. Horror, horror. She paced back and forth across the kitchen, slicing the steaks, stirring the sauce. Round her head, circling, round the light, the mosquitoes of a sweltering night. A night on which compassion was raw as bad love. Between her two breasts sweat slid down. Faith was breaking her, the heat of the stove stung her eyes.</p>
<p>Then her husband arrived, her brothers and their wives arrived, her brothers’ children arrived.</p>
<p>They ate dinner with all the windows open, on the ninth floor. An airplane went shuddering past, threatening in the heat of the sky. Though made with few eggs, the dinner was good. Her children stayed up too, playing on the rug with the others. It was summer, it would be pointless to send them to bed. Ana was a little pale and laughed softly with the others.</p>
<p>After dinner, at last, the first cooler breeze came in through the windows. They sat around the table, the family. Worn out from the day, glad not to disagree, so ready not to find fault. They laughed at everything, with kind and human hearts. The children were growing up admirably around them. And as if it were a butterfly, Ana caught the instant between her fingers before it was never hers again.</p>
<p>Later, when everyone had gone and the children were already in bed, she was a brute woman looking out the window. The city was asleep and hot. Would whatever the blind man had unleashed fit into her days? How many years would it take for her to grow old again? The slightest movement and she’d trample one of the children. But with a lover’s mischief, she seemed to accept that out of the flower emerged the mosquito, that the giant water lilies floated on the darkness of the lake. The blind man dangled among the fruits of the Botanical Garden.</p>
<p>If that was the oven exploding, the whole house would already be on fire! she thought rushing into the kitchen and finding her husband in front of the spilled coffee.</p>
<p>“What happened?!” she screamed vibrating all over.</p>
<p>He jumped at his wife’s fright. And suddenly laughed in comprehension:</p>
<p>“It was nothing,” he said, “I’m just clumsy.” He looked tired, bags under his eyes.</p>
<p>But encountering Ana’s strange face, he peered at her with greater attention. Then he drew her close, in a swift caress.</p>
<p>“I don’t want anything to happen to you, ever!” she said.</p>
<p>“At least let the oven explode at me,” he answered smiling.</p>
<p>She stayed limp in his arms. This afternoon something tranquil had burst, and a humorous, sad tone was hanging over the house. “Time for bed,” he said, “it’s late.” In a gesture that wasn’t his, but that seemed natural, he held his wife’s hand, taking her along without looking back, removing her from the danger of living.</p>
<p>The dizziness of benevolence was over.</p>
<p>And, if she had passed through love and its hell, she was now combing her hair before the mirror, for an instant with no world at all in her heart. Before going to bed, as if putting out a candle, she blew out the little flame of the day.</p>

<p>But it was spring. Even the lion licked the lioness’s smooth forehead. Both animals blond. The woman averted her eyes from the cage, where the hot smell alone recalled the carnage she’d come looking for at the Zoological Garden. Then the lion paced calmly, mane flowing, and the lioness slowly recomposed the head of a sphinx upon her outstretched paws. “But this is love, it’s love again,” railed the woman trying to locate her own hatred but it was spring and two lions had been in love. Fists in her coat pockets, she looked around, surrounded by the cages, caged by the shut cages. She kept walking. Her eyes were so focused on searching that her vision sometimes darkened into a kind of sleep, and then she’d recompose herself as in the coolness of a pit.<br>          But the giraffe was a virgin with freshly shorn braids. With the mindless innocence of large and nimble and guiltless things. The woman in the brown coat averted her eyes, feeling sick, sick. Unable—in front of the perching aerial giraffe, in front of that silent wingless bird—unable to locate inside herself the spot where her sickness was the worst, the sickest spot, the spot of hatred, she who had gone to the Zoological Garden to get sick. But not in front of the giraffe that was more landscape than being. Not in front of that flesh that had become distracted in its height and remoteness, the nearly verdant giraffe. She was searching for other animals, trying to learn from them how to hate. The hippopotamus, the moist hippopotamus. That plump roll of flesh, rounded and mute flesh awaiting some other plump and mute flesh. No. For there was such humble love in remaining just flesh, such sweet martyrdom in not knowing how to think.<br>          But it was spring, and, tightening the fist in her coat pocket, she’d kill those monkeys levitating in their cage, monkeys happy as weeds, monkeys leaping about gently, the female monkey with her resigned, loving gaze, and the other female suckling her young. She’d kill them with fifteen dry bullets: the woman’s teeth clenched until her jaw ached. The nakedness of the monkeys. The world that saw no danger in being naked. She’d kill the nakedness of the monkeys. One monkey stared back at her as he gripped the bars, his emaciated arms outstretched in a crucifix, his bare chest exposed without pride. But she wouldn’t aim at his chest, she’d shoot the monkey between the eyes, she’d shoot between those eyes that were staring at her without blinking. Suddenly the woman averted her face: because the monkey’s pupils were covered with a gelatinous white veil, in his eyes the sweetness of sickness, he was an old monkey—the woman averted her face, trapping between her teeth a feeling she hadn’t come looking for, she quickened her step, even so, turned her head in alarm back toward the monkey with its arms outstretched: he kept staring straight ahead. “Oh no, not this,” she thought. And as she fled, she said: “God, teach me only how to hate.”<br>          “I hate you,” she said to a man whose only crime was not loving her. “I hate you,” she said in a rush. But she didn’t even know how you were supposed to do it. How did you dig in the earth until locating that black water, how did you open a passage through the hard earth and never reach yourself? She roamed the zoo amid mothers and children. But the elephant withstood his own weight. That whole elephant endowed with the capacity to crush with a mere foot. But he didn’t crush anything. That power that nevertheless would tamely let itself be led to a circus, a children’s elephant. And his eyes, with an old man’s benevolence, trapped inside that hulking, inherited flesh. The oriental elephant. And the oriental spring too, and everything being born, everything flowing downstream.<br>          The woman then tried the camel. The camel in rags, humpbacked, chewing at himself, absorbed in the process of getting to know his food. She felt weak and tired, she’d hardly eaten in two days. The camel’s large, dusty eyelashes above eyes dedicated to the patience of an internal craft. Patience, patience, patience, was all she was finding in this windblown spring. Tears filled the woman’s eyes, tears that didn’t spill over, trapped inside the patience of her inherited flesh. The camel’s dusty odor was all that arose from this encounter she had come for: for dry hatred, not for tears. She approached the bars of the pen, inhaled the dust of that old carpet where ashen blood flowed, sought its impure tepidness, pleasure ran down her back into the distress, but still not the distress she’d come looking for. In her stomach the urge to kill convulsed in hunger pangs. But not the camel in ragged burlap. “Dear God, who shall be my mate in this world?”<br>          So she went alone to have her violence. In the zoo’s small amusement park she waited meditatively in the line of lovers for her turn on the roller coaster.<br>          And there she was sitting now, quiet in her brown coat. Her seat stopped for now, the roller-coaster machinery stopped for now. Separate from everyone in her seat, she looked like she was sitting in a Church. Her lowered eyes saw the ground between the tracks. The ground where simply out of love—love, love, not love!—where out of pure love weeds sprouted between the tracks in a light green so dizzying that she had to avert her eyes in tormented temptation. The breeze made the hair rise on the back of her neck, she shivered refusing it, in temptation refusing, it was always so much easier to love.<br>          But all of a sudden came that lurch of the guts, that halting of a heart caught by surprise in midair, that fright, the triumphant fury with which her seat hurtled her into the nothing and immediately swept her up like a rag doll, skirts flying, the deep resentment with which she became mechanical, her body automatically joyful—the girlfriends’ shrieks!—her gaze wounded by that great surprise, that offense, “they were having their way with her,” that great offense—the girlfriends’ shrieks!—the enormous bewilderment at finding herself spasmodically frolicking, they were having their way with her, her pure whiteness suddenly exposed. How many minutes? the minutes of an extended scream of a train rounding the bend, and the joy of another plunge through the air insulting her like a kick, her dancing erratically in the wind, dancing frantically, whether or not she wanted it her body shook like someone laughing, that sensation of laughing to death, the sudden death of someone who had neglected to shred all those papers in the drawer, not the deaths of other people, her own, always her own. She who could have taken advantage of the others screaming to let out her own howl of lament, she forgot herself, all she felt was fright.<br>          And now this silence, sudden too. They’d come back to earth, the machinery once again completely stopped.<br>          Pale, kicked out of a Church, she looked at the stationary earth from which she’d departed and back to which she’d been delivered. She straightened out her skirts primly. She didn’t look at anyone. Contrite as on that day when in the middle of everyone the entire contents of her purse had spilled onto the ground and everything that was valuable while lying secretly in her purse, once exposed in the dust of the street, revealed the pettiness of a private life of precautions: face powder, receipt, fountain pen, her retrieving from the curb the scaffolding of her life. She rose from her seat stunned as if shaking off a collision. Though no one was paying attention, she smoothed her skirt again, did what she could so no one would notice how weak and disgraced she was, haughtily protecting her broken bones. But the sky was spinning in her empty stomach; the earth, rising and falling before her eyes, remained distant for a few moments, the earth that is always so troublesome. For a moment the woman wanted, in mutely sobbing fatigue, to reach out her hand to the troublesome earth: her hand reached out like that of a crippled beggar. But as if she had swallowed the void, her heart stunned.<br>          Was that it? That was it. Of the violence, that was it.<br>          She headed back toward the animals. The ordeal of the roller coaster had left her subdued. She didn’t make it much further: she had to rest her forehead against the bars of a cage, exhausted, her breath coming quick and shallow. From inside the cage the coati looked at her. She looked at him. Not a single word exchanged. She could never hate that coati who looked at her with the silence of an inquiring body. Disturbed, she averted her eyes from the coati’s simplicity. The curious coati asking her a question the way a child asks. And she averting her eyes, concealing from him her deadly mission. Her forehead was pressed against the bars so firmly that for an instant it looked like she was the caged one and a free coati was examining her.<br>          The cage was always on the side she was: she let out a moan that seemed to come from the soles of her feet. After that another moan.<br>          Then, born from her womb, it rose again, beseeching, in a swelling wave, that urge to kill—her eyes welled up grateful and black in a near-happiness, it wasn’t hatred yet, for the time being just the tormented urge to hate like a desire, the promise of cruel blossoming, a torment like love, the urge to hate promising itself sacred blood and triumph, the spurned female had become spiritualized through her great hope. But where, where to find the animal that would teach her to have her own hatred? the hatred that was hers by right but that lay excruciatingly out of reach? where could she learn to hate so as not to die of love? And from whom? The world of spring, the world of beasts that in spring Christianize themselves with paws that claw but do not wound … oh no more of this world! no more of this perfume, of this weary panting, no more of this forgiveness in everything that will die one day as if made to surrender. Never forgiveness, if that woman forgave one more time, even just once, her life would be lost—she let out a hoarse, brief moan, the coati gave a start—caged in she looked around, and since she wasn’t the kind of person people paid attention to, she crouched down like an old solitary assassin, a child ran past without noticing her.<br>          Then she started walking again, smaller now, tough, fists once again braced in her pockets, the undercover assassin, and everything was caught in her chest. In her chest that knew only how to give up, knew only how to withstand, knew only how to beg forgiveness, knew only how to forgive, that had only learned how to have the sweetness of unhappiness, and learned only how to love, love, love. Imagining that she might never experience the hatred of which her forgiveness had always been made, this caused her heart to moan indecently, she began walking so fast that she seemed to have found a sudden destiny. She was almost running, her shoes throwing her off balance, and giving her a physical fragility that once again reduced her to the imprisoned female, her steps mechanically assumed the beseeching despair of the frail, she who was nothing more than a frail woman herself. But, if she could take off her shoes, could she avoid the joy of walking barefoot? how could you not love the ground on which you walk? She moaned again, stopped before the bars of an enclosure, pressed her hot face against the iron’s rusty coolness. Eyes deeply shut she tried to bury her face between the hardness of the railings, her face attempted an impossible passage through the narrow bars, just as before when she’d seen the newborn monkey seek in the blindness of hunger the female’s breast. A fleeting comfort came from how the bars seemed to hate her while opposing her with the resistance of frozen iron.<br>          She opened her eyes slowly. Her eyes coming from their own darkness couldn’t see a thing in the afternoon’s faint light. She stood there breathing. Gradually she started to make things out again, gradually shapes began solidifying, she was tired, crushed by the sweetness of tiredness. Her head tilted inquiringly toward the budding trees, her eyes saw the small white clouds. Without hope, she heard the lightness of a stream. She lowered her head again and stood gazing at the buffalo in the distance. Inside a brown coat, breathing without interest, no one interested in her, she interested in no one.<br>          A certain peace at last. The breeze ruffling the hair on her forehead as if brushing the hair of someone who had just died, whose forehead was still damp with sweat. Gazing detachedly at that great dry plot surrounded by tall railings, the buffalo plot. The black buffalo was standing still at the far end of that plot. Then he paced in the distance on his narrow haunches, his dense haunches. His neck thicker than his tensed flanks. Seen straight on, his large head was broader than his body, blocking the rest from view, like a severed head. And on his head those horns. At a distance he slowly paced with his torso. He was a black buffalo. So black that from afar his face looked featureless. Atop his blackness the erect stark whiteness of his horns.<br>          The woman might have left but the silence felt good in the waning afternoon.<br>          And in the silence of the paddock, those meandering steps, the dry dust beneath those dry hooves. At a distance, in the midst of his calm pacing, the black buffalo looked at her for an instant. The next instant, the woman again saw only the hard muscle of his body. Maybe he hadn’t looked at her. She couldn’t tell, since all she could discern of that shadowy head were its outlines. But once more he seemed to have either seen or sensed her.<br>          The woman raised her head a little, retracted it slightly in misgiving. Body motionless, head back, she waited.<br>          And once more the buffalo seemed to notice her.<br>          As if she couldn’t stand feeling what she had felt, she suddenly averted her face and looked at a tree. Her heart didn’t beat in her chest, her heart was beating hollowly somewhere between her stomach and intestines.<br>          The buffalo made another slow loop. The dust. The woman clenched her teeth, her whole face ached a little.<br>          The buffalo with his constricted torso. In the luminous dusk he was a body blackened with tranquil rage, the woman sighed slowly. A white thing had spread out inside her, white as paper, fragile as paper, intense as a whiteness. Death droned in her ears. The buffalo’s renewed pacing brought her back to herself and, with another long sigh, she returned to the surface. She didn’t know where she’d been. She was standing, very feeble, just emerged from that white and remote thing where she’d been.<br>          And from where she looked back at the buffalo.<br>          The buffalo larger now. The black buffalo. Ah, she said suddenly with a pang. The buffalo with his back turned to her, standing still. The woman’s whitened face didn’t know how to call him. Ah! she said provoking him. Ah! she said. Her face was covered in deathly whiteness, her suddenly gaunt face held purity and veneration. Ah! she goaded him through clenched teeth. But with his back turned, the buffalo completely still.<br>          She grabbed a rock off the ground and hurled it into the paddock. The torso’s stillness, quieted down even blacker: the rock rolled away uselessly.<br>          Ah! she said shaking the bars. That white thing was spreading inside her, viscous like a kind of saliva. The buffalo with his back turned.<br>          Ah, she said. But this time because inside her at last was flowing a first trickle of black blood.<br>          The first instant was one of pain. As if the world had convulsed for this blood to flow. She stood there, listening to that first bitter oil drip as in a grotto, the spurned female. Her strength was still trapped between the bars, but something incomprehensible and burning, ultimately incomprehensible, was happening, a thing like a joy tasted in her mouth. Then the buffalo turned toward her.<br>          The buffalo turned, stood still, and faced her from afar.<br>          I love you, she then said with hatred to the man whose great unpunishable crime was not wanting her. I hate you, she said beseeching the buffalo’s love.<br>          Provoked at last, the enormous buffalo approached unhurriedly.<br>          He approached, the dust rose. The woman waited with her arms hanging alongside her coat. Slowly he approached. She didn’t take a single step back. Until he reached the railings and stopped there. There stood the buffalo and the woman, directly across from each other. She didn’t look at his face, or his mouth, or his horns. She looked him in the eye.<br>          And the buffalo’s eyes, his eyes looked her in the eye. And such a deep pallor was exchanged that the woman fell into a drowsy torpor. Standing, in a deep sleep. Small red eyes were looking at her. The eyes of the buffalo. The woman was dazed in surprise, slowly shaking her head. The calm buffalo. Slowly the woman was shaking her head, astonished by the hatred with which the buffalo, tranquil with hatred, was looking at her. Nearly absolved, shaking an incredulous head, her mouth slightly open. Innocent, curious, plunging deeper and deeper into those eyes staring unhurriedly at her, simple, with a drowsy sigh, neither wanting nor able to flee, trapped in this mutual murder. Trapped as if her hand were forever stuck to the dagger she herself had thrust. Trapped, as she slid spellbound down the railing. In such slow dizziness that just before her body gently crumpled the woman saw the whole sky and a buffalo.</p>
